[[" Wow there's definitely a reason why this is the most reviewed restaurant in Toronto. Definitely call in with a reservation to this place because it was packedddddd. First of all the place was HUGE. When you walk in it looks like a very small shop but don't be fooled. The vibe felt extremely homey and vintage. I loved it. I ordered the Tea Mac cocktail which was basically an alcoholic Thai tea and it was amazing. I could barely taste the alcohol it was so good. I also ordered the Tom yum soup which was fantastic. The portion was smaller but it was the perfect amount of spice. For the entree I got the Khao Soi, I was blown away. I typically don't love curries but this was a very light chicken coconut curry with noodles. It was soooo good. And for dessert we got the egg custard sticky rice. Probably some of the best Thai food I've ever had in my life.", 'positive'], [" Long line up but definitely worth the hype. For the money, the food is excellent. Their curry comes in coconuts.

I'm from NYC which is filled with so many Thai restaurants but sadly I have to come all the way to TO for the best. For appetizers: the grabong- so crispy and savory but a little sweet, the Miang Kung if you want something interesting and very authentic. For entrees: I always have such a hard time deciding between pad gra prow (minced pork) and Khao soi- they are both ridiculously good. I always have been meaning to try the fried fish because it was something I ate so much while in south east asia but I can never not choose Pad Gra Prow or Khao Soi. The pad thai is also amazing. Anything you choose, you really can't go wrong at this restaurant. It's always crowded but 100% worth the wait.", 'positive'], [" I'm a thai foody, so I had to bring my colleagues during lunchtime and boy, was there a wait! Tip: Learn from my mistake, and call to make reservation in advance. There's lots of great selections. I would recommend 4 dishes for 3 people to share together. The khao soi was amazing. Very rich sweet salty soup full of coconut taste and flavourings. The papaya salad is always great; it's soaked in tamarind sauce giving it a sweet & sour taste.

My heart is won over by the Chang Mai beef noodle for how limey and mouth-wateringly spicy it is. The thin threads of fine rice noodle held the hot and sour flavours so well. They also don\'t skimp on ingredients and gave me many tender beef shank chunks to stuff me full for the rest of the day. My partner had the shrimp khao soi and was equally impressed.

I would say average spice eaters could definitely handle mild/medium levels.  The waiters were all friendly and accommodating! You HAVE to make a reservation the DAY before!

My only small complaint would be that my water had no ice, and my thai iced tea was filled to the top with very crushed up ice that made it really hard to drink and also made it so that there was only a tiny bit of tea actually in the cup :(. The small amount of tea that i did get was very good though! I would rate the presentation/look/feel of the food a 10/10 but the drink (even the cup was not so pretty) would fall a lot lower on that scale.

Essentially extorting me and being completely unreasonable, as the food was coming out so slowly there was NO WAY it was already prepared. I didn\'t want to make a scene at my party, but essentially I got scammed $500 for some "extra prepared food" costs....wtf From being a regular to never coming back again - their management staff completely ruined my night.

I tried the gobernador taco, which is shrimp and marlin. First off, this is a very unique taco and I don't think it will be for everyone. I am pretty neutral towards sea food but from all the rave reviews, I was expecting it to be amazing. Honestly, the taste is very average imo. Shrimp tastes like any other grilled shrimp and the marlin just tastes like fish. The entire taco was also very sour because of the pickles and hot sauce added.  What made my experience very disappointing was the sheer amount of oil/grease found in the taco. I attached photos and you can see how much grease there was. I couldn't even finish my taco because the tortilla was just drenched in oil. I literally felt like I was drinking grease with every bite. I don't know who wouldn't be disgusted by so much grease. I'm hoping this is a one off thing and the person making my taco just went too heavy handed on oil, but I'm def not going back to find out.

Banh mi boys goes well beyond traditional and had some very interesting options, including the kabli beef which I got. It combined the traditional ingredients of a banh mi with Korean style beef... delicious. The sandwiches are quite large so don't feel like you need a lot of sides, or maybe share a sandwich and some sides.

It was a perfect blend between vegetables and meat... both crunchy and fresh from the vegetables and hot and soft from the chicken.

And from the bun: either the pure softness of the bao or the crunchy layer followed by the softness of the remaining bread from the bun. My only regret was not trying the taco until recently. I figured I had nothing to gain since I loved the baos and buns so much; but they have some sort of crazy science with their taco which is unlike a soft taco I've had anywhere else. Very fresh, doesn't split, not too heavy and almost roti-like - but different still. It doesn't hurt that it was holding the squid which was delicious.

I can't really recommend highly on this place as it seems creative is on their side, and the price doesn't seem overly bad, however the taste and cleanness is what i doubt.  i would not want to try again, after having stomach problems from this restaurant.", 'negative'], [' Prior to eating at Banh Mi Boys, I had high expectations and was excited, as considerable hype surrounds this establishment. I had heard that it was "the best" The place is very narrow and tiny. Even on a non busy day, it evokes feelings of claustrophobia and it was almost unbearable when we went on a Saturday afternoon -\xa0everyone was packed like sardines. The place is relatively clean and the decor isn\'t offensive. My group and I ordered 2 kalbi beef tacos, 1 squid taco, 1 order of kimchi fries and 1 order of regular fries. The prices are more than reasonable as the total ending being in the low to mid $20 range, which is good for all the food we ordered. However, the food is mediocre AT BEST. As previously mentioned, the place is small and as a result, seating is extremely limited and near impossible on a busy day, so we just asked them to bag our food. Our bags quickly became drenched and soggy due to the greasy nature of the food.  I am ethnically Vietnamese and I know that this place is Asian fusion, so I\'m not expecting authenticity at all... but I wouldn\'t even classify the food as even partially Vietnamese. I\'d say it\'s barely even Asian food. Now for the food itself: 1 squid taco - The highest compliment I can give it is palatable and marginally above intolerable. The taco was too dry and salty, particularly the squid. It seemed that I was the one out of my group who tolerated the food the most. 2 beef kalbi tacos -\xa0I also went with 2 people who each ate a beef kalbi taco. They said it was very disappointing. 1 order of regular fries - If you go, don\'t order them. There is seriously nothing special about them -\xa0they\'re soggy, floppy and poorly seasoned. Just go to McDonalds. 1 order of kimchi fries -\xa02 people who are avid fans of Korean food didn\'t like them. With all of the aforementioned in mind, I probably would have given this establishment 2 to 2.5 stars -\xa0while the food wasn\'t very good, it wasn\'t completely awful and we finished our food. The catalyst for the 1 star review, which I\'ve never given a business on Yelp before, was the terrible customer service which cemented us never coming back.   The girl at the register wrote down our order incorrectly. She hadn\'t waited for us to finalize our order and wrote down what we had initially ordered (but later changed) while we were still deliberating. So when they were actually making the food and called us, she read off the wrong order. I obviously was confused and questioned her.  I didn\'t want to trouble the employee (even though we paid for the food) and told her that whatever they made would be fine with me... but one of the guys in the back was really aggressive and said very audibly (we heard him loud and clear), "NOW WE\'LL HAVE TO MAKE ANOTHER ONE"  First, we didn\'t actually ask him to do that. Secondly, this wasn\'t our fault as it was the error of another employee. Finally, his attitude and demeanour was irked us. I don\'t expect people to be bubbly and super friendly -\xa0as long as the experience is polite and smooth, I won\'t ever complain. But to act like we were personally inconveniencing is egregious - that\'s your job. Finally, the last nail in the coffin was when he very patronizingly ordered us to not do "that" again. We still don\'t know what we aren\'t supposed to do again (except come back). The situation is attributed to one employee making a mistake (one that I honestly wouldn\'t have minded) and then another one escalating the situation. I know that my review is an anomaly among the majority, but I did want to share my experience in hopes that the management will read it and implement much needed change.', 'negative'], [' Got food poisoning from this restaurant, was not able to give it another chance as I can no longer bring myself to eat here.', 'negative'], [" I preface this with the caveat that I'm a vegetarian.

I\'m going to first start off by saying, if you are thinking of coming here, make a reservation now even if it\'s weeks away because I made the mistake of booking only 1 week in advance and I almost didn\'t get a table. This takes me to my first point.  1. They actually make calls to the wait-list! We had emailed them about wanting a table on a specific date and hadn\'t heard back. On the day of our requested reservation, they called and let us know of a cancellation. We almost didn\'t take it, but thank god we did! 2. The service is impeccable! We were greeted by a warm hostess and served by the whole restaurant. Every single staff knew exactly what they were serving that evening, every dish that came out (explanations were always given), and what they were doing. Everyone was friendly and cool. 3. THE FOOD. Their chefs menu is a must try, everything about it is just amazing. Taste = excellent; portions = 8-course filling; price = out of this world (Toronto); presentation = Instagram-worthy. Nothing on that menu is re-create-able by someone who hasn\'t attended culinary school. And the bonus, it\'s always a surprise! You don\'t know what you will get and that\'s the best part. Not to worry, they asked for allergies and dietary restrictions so very flexible and accommodating. 4. Atmosphere is homey. Now some people might find it crowded and not very "romantic" but actually I think that\'s what makes this place so different. Half the tables are close-up seats to an exposed kitchen and the other half are next to a bar (I think) and the seats are quite close together. But there was something about the staff that made this place feel very homey that I didn\'t care if I was close to the party next to us. There\'s a private space available for parties of up to 12 also which looked very nice. 5. The experience was special. Every staff was notified that it was our anniversary after the staff asked us, once, what we were celebrating. We got a glass of sparkling wine each and they accommodated a "shortened" chef\'s menu for us due to our limited seating time (regular chef\'s menu requires almost 3 hours + booking in advance I think, since our table was a cancellation we only had 2 hours, they tried to make it work by giving us a shortened menu so we can still have the experience just within 2 hours). Worked out in our favor cause I think I still got just as much food but it came faster and the price was even better which takes me to my 6th point. 6. THE PRICE. Okay, finding a tasting menu in Toronto is not easy, and it\'s often so expensive. Every other place I found was like $120+ for 5 dishes. Here the full menu of a minimum of 8 courses, is $80-$95/person depending on what they are serving. We got our shortened menu for $70! Like that\'s unreal and the food was amazing and it seriously worked in our favor so I\'m so happy we decided to come. On short, 10/10 would come back and recommend. This will be the place I will be consistently recommending to anyone who asks. Hats off to the chefs and all the staff!', 'positive'], [" I've been here twice now, and both experiences were sublime.

Bonus waiting all that time for water we did have a chance to look over the menu.  There definitely is a lot of intresting things on the menu that I wanted to try and did not know where to begin. I thought to go for a classic burger. My measuring stick for a restaurant is that if they can make the "plain regular" stuff taste awesome, then everything else should be that much more awesome. Unfortunately my burger came out rare/undercooked which is where this negative review is coming from. Regardless of anything else, if you can not even deliver a simple burger to me that is properly cooked its a fail for me.

We had a really hard time narrowing down where we wanted to go when we were visiting Toronto so I did a lot of research on Yelp and kept coming across Byblos.

I will say the outside of the restaurant is not very appealing and we were kind of hoping to sit outside but they do not have an outdoor patio. That was okay though because when you walk inside, the ambiance is very neat with a modern Mediterranean flare to it. We were seated on the downstairs level but we quickly realized that they have a massive upstairs area with a full bar and tables that accommodate larger groups.

Food:  The menu at Byblos reads like a nonsensical mixed bag of "exotic" sounding ingredients that don\'t really go together. This is reflected in the food as the flavour simply isn\'t there. The food was either too bland (which is odd considering all the "spices" used), or tasted unbalanced. To add, the technique is amateur at best and demonstrates a very basic understanding of middle-eastern cooking. I expect more at these prices.  The Tah-Dig for instance is very basic and on the dry more crispy side, which is a common mistake but not acceptable at these prices. The dish tastes unbalanced with an odd mix of ingredients (very sweet fig, A LOT of pistachios, duck (?) and RAW FLOWERS. Yes. Raw, flavourless, flowers). I\'ve seen modern, creative takes on tahdig in Iran with an impressive fusion of flavours from across the region. This tasted pedestrian and bland in comparison...not to mention the flower petals that \xa0added nothing to the dish. I won\'t even get into the crispy duck confit rice...just don\'t (spoiler, it also has flowers...). The dessert was okay, I found it a bit gimmicky but didn\'t mind it overall...though it also has flower petals in it! There is a pattern folks! This restaurant is really trying to make flower happen!  Service: Mixed impressions on this front. The waitress asked me how my food is. I was honest and I\'ll admit I was in the middle of poking fun at the flowers when she came over and she likely heard me! I asked about the flowers and the caucasian waitress proceeded to try and "educate" me on how the use of flowers is "common" in middle-eastern food. I am middle-eastern. This simply isn\'t true, I\'ve never in my life seen actual rose petals in my food. I never asked for her condescending input, nor did I express that I didn\'t wish to pay for anything, she could have just left it and walked away. Instead, she brought over her manager (I never asked to see a manager), who was polite and diplomatic and asked for our feedback. Again, I never asked to have these conversations with staff at the restaurant but they asked for my opinion, so I was honest! The manager took the duck rice off the bill. She also gave us a free dessert, which was greatly appreciated considering that was the part of the meal I enjoyed. Kudos to this manager, she really listened and also didn\'t take my humour personally like that waitress. The rest of the experience was unfortunately poor as this waitress gave us attitude because she clearly hated me for having opinions about my own culture.  Overall:  I think Byblos is trying really hard to appeal to a specific demographic (i\'ll give you a hint, it\'s not middle-eastern people). I\'d say this chef is trying to do a lot with each dish, maybe too much to make the menu sound more creative than it actually is. It just tastes misguided.

Surely Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery is Toronto's best, and it was worth every minute of my forty-five minute wait on a Friday evening.  Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere? Yes, the lines at Bang Bang can spiral seemingly out of control, but the neighborhood is conducive to it, there's signage, and above all else it's worth it. Even though they're surely swamped at all hours of the day, the servers are friendly and efficient.  One of my favorite parts of Bang Bang was that, to keep things moving, they curb tasting during peak hours, which honestly makes a lot of sense. Think about it - when you go elsewhere, to say a restaurant, are you able to sample what you order beforehand? Of course not, and in this case it's a reasonable trade off to keep the line moving. Star.  Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost? $8.90 CAD got me a colossal ice cream sandwich packed with two full sized scoops. While I initially scoffed a bit at the price point, after a quick bit of math I realized that for well under $10.00 I was getting two scoops of specialty ice cream and two everything cookies, which was a bargain. Star.  Stars 3 and 4: How was the food? I don't have enough superlatives in my vocabulary to describe how amazing this all was. For starters, the everything cookie is a new benchmark for amazing cookies, and I could have eaten a dozen of these and been perfectly content. From there, the Burnt Toffee and CinnaCrunch ice creams were absolutely out of this world, and competed easily with some of my favorites elsewhere around North America. Amazing. Two Stars.

There was a pumpkin flavor there, admittedly, but it was very subtle and almost entirely lacking in sweetness. I ate a few bites and threw the rest away.

The papaya salad was a good starter, but surprisingly the papaya was not as mashed and wilted as I assumed it would be. The strips of papaya we\'re still quite firm and didn\'t absorb as much of the dressing as I\'d hope. Still delicious but pricey at $13.  The Bangkok-style pad thai was amazing!! Portion size was standard and it is so saucy, my favourite type of pad thai!! Was not dry and was actually spicy, I could see the chopped up Thai chilli peppers in there. I like how it was served with uncooked bean sprouts on the side to either mix in yourself or eat separately to cleanse the palate.  Only issue was the fact that you can\'t get "no peanuts" in this style of pad thai, if you don\'t want it you have to get the other pad thai dish. Price went up to almost $18 which is steep for a noodle dish. Definitely will still come and try the pad gra pao and pad see ew for sure as I\'ve heard nothing but amazing things about these two dishes!', 'positive'], [' Bomb food. So flavorful.

I love spicy food and most places aren't able to give me the level of heat that I want while cooking the dish so I appreciate that Khao San Road offers a variety of spice levels. I was tempted to try their hottest option but ended up going for Thai level spicy which ended up being the right level of spice for me.

A lot of things could have gone wrong with management, the new coach, and Kawhi\'s health/attitude; however, in the end the Raptors experienced a best-case scenario by winning a championship. Likewise, Blaze Pizza could have easily been like just any other pizza chain (Like any other Raptor\'s year: good but not great), but instead it has earned the title of the Champion of Pizza Chains Food and Atmosphere: Blaze Pizza allows customers to completely customize their pizzas ... For a fixed price of $12.85, you can create the pizza of your dreams!! During the ordering process, an assembly line of friendly staff members will add any toppings you choose (like sauce, cheeses, meats, and vegetables) in virtually unlimited quantity onto your pizza. \xa0The ingredients are fresh and delicious, and the pizza\'s thin crust is baked to crispy perfection in about 3 minutes. The staff there are extremely friendly and easy-going. And we say this with confidence because numerous staff dealt with Sam\'s BS with a smile \xa0(Sam told them to address Paulina as "Catwoman" and the name was called at least 3 times along the assembly line from start to end). Furthermore, Blaze Pizza offers a delightful and spacious ambiance. And, not that it really matters, but their playlist is pretty fricken nice, so thumbs up there. The only reason we didn\'t give it a full 5/5 is because we didn\'t like their selection of housemade drinks. However, the drinks are bottomless and they also offer a normal soda fountain with all the classic sodas. Conclusion: Google reviews gives Blaze Pizza a 4.5/5, and for once we will go higher and give it a 4.75/5! A 4.75 puts it in the "definitely worth a visit" category and we highly recommend Blaze Pizza due to its affordable price, quality ingredients, and overall casual-fast dining experience.

They are using the gloved hands in and out etc. Some of the sauces have a brush that would touch the pizza crust - so I purposely got the tomato with no brush.  I think if you are not gluten free/not getting the gluten free crust this a great place.  For gluten free - it's questionable for me. First the price - $4!! That's the most I've seen for a gluten free crust - and I've tried many GF pizza places (this isn't a service restaurant either - so it seems excessive). It's a small pizza too. I can't finish one, but suspect it's personal for many people.  Secondly, the cross contamination is dependent on who you get. Some people are more careful than others.  Last - the crust is too thin. Usually that would be a good thing, but the crust does not hold the toppings because it's just too thin. I have tried this with extra toppings (make your own) to a simple margherita pizza. The toppings just fall right off - even the sauce and cheese. They need to either add more dough to thicken it or add something to hold the pizza together. Again, have tried many GF pizza crusts and this was a disaster. You would need a knife and fork to eat or let it get cold (where it finally does hold).  The toppings are fresh and the crust is good - just together you can't eat it like a pizza.  For almost $18 for a small pizza - not worth it. Again, this is a self service place.  I hope they build on their crust and potentially decrease the price. Even Pizza Nova does a better crust.

As you wouldnt need any soy sauce with each bite, every nigiri made by the chef serves its own purpose.

That being said, be prepared to pay lots for the quality and you possibly wont be full. Came with a party of 4 and definitely left feeling hungry, but we did include the steak which was simply divine and highly recommend! So tender, juicy, perfectly cooked to medium rare.

There are 10 or so carefully crafted rolls with perfect seasoning in each for a burst of flavor in each bite. Their fish are carefully seasoned, and even delicious feel intimidated by raw fish because it doesn't feel fishy... if that makes sense.  Ever since, I have been back to Miku three times because I just can't get enough! I have tried their calamari, their specialty uni platter, and sashimi.

This is the first time we've had this roll in its entirety as one ingredient in the roll was sold out the last few times.

Their sashimi platter is fresh, but just okay. Besides that to start, there was lobster tail and oysters, tuna tartare, and seared scallop with bacon bits. Each was plated in Arita plateware. Each was also unique in taste, but worth the price. The main is a beef tenderloin that is super tender and scrumptious. For additional fee, the steak is paired with heavenly foie gras that just melts in your mouth with umami. And after that, there is a selection of pressed and torched sushi, and Miku is known for their torched sushi which is flavourful and delectable.

Never had bad service every time i have gone. They have coat service at the front for winter and the waiters (even the ones that aren't looking after your table) sometimes just stop by to chat. The cost is not cheap. It's pretty pricey. The rolls average around $20 for only a few pieces. The sashimi can get extremely pricey. Their prime platter only has 9 pieces for a whopping $60.

Obviously I had to choose Jacobs as I've been dying to try it after hearing it is arguably the best steakhouse in Toronto.  To start, we had the salad with crispy bacon and cheese topped off with an anchovie. The waiter made the salad right in front of us so it was an interesting watch. Then came the main course. We ordered the A5 Black Kagoshima striploin from Japan, the Canadian Prime High River Ribeye, the duck fat fries, and the creamed spinach. I have had Kobe steak in the past and that blew my mind. Although my mind was not blown to the same extent, I was delightfully surprised. The feeling of the melting fat harmonized itself perfectly with the taste of the beef. The 20oz ribeye was huge and was packed with juice. The fries and creamed spinach were also very good but my stomach was focused on the steaks.  The service here was unrivaled. The quality of service was equivalent to the time I tried out a three Michelin star restaurant during my China trip. The waiters were very friendly, helpful, and cleaned our table after every dish. Just walking into the place I could feel how fancy it was. From the candle lit atmosphere, to the soft live performing pianoist in the background. I was almost going to pick my daily T-shirt with sweater combo when I was getting dressed in the morning. Good thing I wore something slightly fancier!

The guy who made our salad didn\'t ask if it was our first time or anything he just said " need me to explain everything?" After waiting quite a while our steaks, lobster and mash came out a little after 11. My steak tasted like a chunk of fat. I understand its suppose to be "melt in your mouth tender" but not " melt in your mouth fat".

Well, how romantic could your dinner be when you are cramped behind a tiny table that has another table at a distance of 20 cm?

The service in itself was far from spectacular and rather nonexistent, no prompt water or wine refills, we had to resort to pouring our own wine. Cesar salad that was made at the table was made behind our back because of the cramped space around the table. It also took 20 minutes for a server to finally figure out the dressing, after about 6 minutes I just turned away and carried on conversation with my partner. Food was the biggest obstacle of all I believe. Salad was bland and the lettuce used was cut into super large chunks, making it challenging to eat. I had to return my steak because it was overcooked and charred to obscenity instead of medium rare I requested. My partner did not find his steak to be any better than a restaurant we frequent that is 3 times cheaper. Duck fries were dry and overcooked. Manager offered us desert as a compensation for the meal.

If they told us nicely that there isn\'t enough room to stand around and we have to wait outside I would have been fine with it. But the treatment we got was literally like THEY WERE TREATING US LIKE TRESPASSERS. The waitress basically pressured us to leave with the facial expression that basically says "we don\'t care if you got a crappy service because will be enough people around the corner willing to line up for a seat".

Kekou specializes in teas and gelato and seems to ride of the coattails of "all natural" movement that\'s sweeping the world by storm. If you\'re someone with a sweet tooth like me, I wouldn\'t recommend this place due to the lack of sweetness in their foods. However, if you\'re fed up of the overly sweet and sugary foods that bubble tea and gelato franchises have to offer, I\'d definitely give this place a visit.  The first time I visited Kekou, I chose to get italian soda with tapioca, which honestly was more of a mistake on my part. Carbonated drinks and tapioca are a big no no in general. That aside, I still found the italian soda to be more carbonated and bubbly than sweet, which ended up being a bigger disappointment for me (honestly, I don\'t even know why I got italian soda in the first place because I\'m not the biggest fan either). The second time, I made sure to learn from my previous experience and avoided any carbonated drink. Instead, I opted for a strawberry tea (I forgot the specific name). Like the italian soda, it wasn\'t particularly sweet - there was some kind of strawberry jam syrup at the bottom of the drink and that was the extent of the sugar in the drink (the rest of the drink was a bitter, cold, tea). Once again, I wasn\'t thoroughly impressed with the drinks considering the $5-6 pricetag.

They claim it\'s not as hygienic when they have different flavours in a small because it cross contaminates the "new" scoopers. \xa0Then why are they doing two flavours for a medium or larger size?

It really does taste like Vietnamese coffee. The gelato is good itself too. Pretty smooth, but could be better, it's more similar to ice cream here I found.

There are around 16 or so seats in the entire restaurant including 2 tables that are detached from the bar seating.

I was skeptical at first if I would be full by the end of the night but was pleasantly surprised that there are 18-20 \'courses\' that they serve which will most likely fill you up with all of the omakase goodness. Onto the actual food. Now, keep in mind that I\'m used to the takeout sushi platters and bento box/lunch specials at Markham sushi joints so this is more than a couple steps up from sushi I have had in the past. I knew I was in for a treat with the first dish of smoked bonito which (not sure if it was shock factor) was probably my favorite out of all the pieces served. They served a plethora of the best fish found around the world and the chef did a great job of explaining each and every one of them. Having never tasted some of the more unique pieces like the monkfish liver or the snow crab/crab liver, it was pretty cool to taste things I\'ve legitimately never tasted before and not just "elevated" pieces that I have had plenty of already.

Don't worry that you won't get full. They have around 17-18 pieces sushi and the fish is fat so you'll get really full. Service? Chef will ask if you have any allergy before the omasake, then during the middle of the meal, you can tell him if you want less rice because you're getting full. He will try to minimize the rice portion. I got really full at the end so he cut the sushi in half so I can at least taste the fish. Chef will also ask your preference on the amount of wasabi. Will change your plate and clean your plate when you have 1 drop of sauce on your plate. Tea is $3.5-4 but free refill. Take out? You cannot take out the raw fish sushi because it will turn bad, might not be fresh and might affect their reputation. However for cooked food you can take home. Not recommended though. Celebration? You can tell them when you make your reservation. They will not give you an extra dessert but they will give you a candle and you'll be the first one getting dessert.  Food taste? Very very fresh! The fish like squid on the outside and sweet in the inside. I don't really like other fish beside salmon but this place shows me how the good quality taste like. Should try once in a life time.

Yasu is an ode to taste, time, and mastery. Here, the omakase experience - which I admittedly have little experience with - takes the framework of a meal and turns it into something transcendent. My two hours felt like an exercise in perception, opening me up to textures and flavours I'd either never experienced or noticed. Sitting at the counter, watching masters artfully construct these delectable treasures, I had to wonder how much of the experience of tasting the food was informed by watching it being crafted. People sometimes describe 'love' as a secret ingredient in their recipes. Watching the food at Yasu being prepared, this phenomenon loses all abstraction. The love is manifested into tangible skill and precision. It's as important a tool as the knife, and, in fact, is what guides it. What's remarkable is the essentialism employed in imagining each bite. Only a few choice ingredients are pieced together to form what ultimately is the most perfect way each piece of fish could be dressed. Each ingredient does something precise, without masking any of the others. No flavour is wasted, and every constituent element is a celebration of its effect. We taste first with our noses, then with our eyes, and finally with our mouths. At Yasu, we taste with time as well. The time which spaces each bite is what allows us to give every piece its due, and what makes looking at the food being placed in front of you by its creator a beholding. I won't try to describe specific pieces of sushi here because it was all important and speaking on one would mean I'd have to speak on all of them. I will say that this was one of the most beautiful meals of my life, and that I'm tremendously grateful that I got to experience it.", 'positive'], [" We consider ourselves to be foodies, and this was one of the best fine dining experiences we've ever had.  Yasu is an exclusively omakase restaurant, with a hefty price tag of $135/person (and then the option to add on sake pairings on top of that). For that bill, you can expect one of the most professional, well curated, and personal meals you'll ever have. Worthy of any special occasion, for sure.  When you make your reservations, you have the option to select either the sushi bar (12 seats) or a private table (of which there are only three in the restaurant). For us it was a no brainer to sit at the sushi bar - the restaurant is so small that it's not as though the separate tables are much more intimate, and half the treat for us was seeing the pros at work.  Behind the sushi bar are three chefs, and as you come in and are seated you'll see them prepping various elements of their dishes. Over the next two hours, you'll be served approximately 20 plates of sushi - mostly single pieces of sushi, but also a few cases of appetizer type portions. Each chef ends up preparing meals for 1/3 of the room, expertly cutting fish to size, shaping the sushi, and adding sauces and finishing ingredients as appropriate. One of the things that I found very interesting is that, because we said we were fine with wasabi, the chefs used a small pat of wasabi between each rice ball and piece of fish. We were pleasantly surprised at how much depth of flavor that added alone. Chef would then individually plate each piece of sushi for us, explaining the type of fish with each piece. If it's not clear, this is such a special and personal experience. Anyone who appreciates food or exploring different cultures would have a great time watching these professionals at their craft.  In terms of the sushi itself, it's not surprising that it was the best sushi we've ever had. Our favorite part was getting to try some more exotic ingredients that we probably wouldn't otherwise order at a typical sushi restaurant. Because the chefs were crafting each course as it was presented to us, the pacing was perfect - enough time to appreciate each piece, without getting bored before the next was presented. We did start to get pretty full towards the back half of the courses, but not so terribly full that we couldn't still appreciate each course for what it was. Another thing to note was how accommodating the chefs were - one guest that night couldn't eat shellfish, and another had a preference against super fishy fish like mackerel. The chefs prepared alternative but equally exciting courses for these guests.  If you have an appreciation for sushi and are looking for somewhere to spend a special occasion, this is your place. Obviously it's pricey, but how could it not be when the experience is so individualized? Amazing experience.", 'positive'], [' I have heard of this place for a while and finally decided to celebrate our wedding anniversary here. I gave my virgin omakse experience to Yasu. It was a cozy 12-seater restaurant hidden in a corner near Spadina subway station. The chef here prepared a tasting sushi menu with fishes selected from different parts of the world. The experience was like a worldwide tour of the fish. The dishes include (in order) fish testicle, salmon roe, sweet shrimp, some fish I can\'t remember, hirame, firefly squid, smoked bonito, snow crab, bluefin tuna, chutoro, botan ebi, Aji, unagi sushi, a piece of tamago and black sesame icecream. We also had an order of the premium sashimi platter for sharing (definitely worth the price). Some of the memorable dishes include: - Sweet shrimp: It was sooo fresh! It was the best I\'ve ever had! - Chutoro: So fatty. I like the texture! - Firefly squid: Fresh and tender - Botan shrimp: So crispy and flavourful. It\'s rarely offered in other Japanese restaurants. - Aji: Well highlighted by the slightly sour flavour from the radish - Rice: It was so soft and the vinegar had a really smooth taste. It was the best sushi rice I\'ve ever had.  - Fish tecticle: Memorable in a different way. It had a creamy texture and when I knew what it was I suddenly had a weird feeling about it. It tasted good though. I think this is something you will feel weird first time trying it, but will fall in love with it on your second try (when you overcome the weird feeling of imagining the organ). My husband loved the dish. It again proved that saying "Cantonese can put any living creature on their dining table". Some of the dishes I don\'t like: - Smoked bonito: Flavouring was weird - Bluefin tuna: To be fair, it\'s just a personal preference. I don\'t like fish with chewy texture in general. Overall, the experience at Yasu was truly exceptional and we didn\'t regret it despite the bill was beautiful too. This is a great place for special occasion. I definitely consider revisiting in the near future.', 'positive'], [' Incredible experience. The sake pairing was on point with the served dishes!

Came here for my birthday with my boyfriend (he treated me to it)... From the start, everything was well organized and everyone was super nice. We were quickly seated and acknowledged by the chef. From the salad, to all the fish in between, soup and dessert, everything was carefully prepped for you and served to you by the chef with an explanation/what it is. You could also let them know if you prefer less wasabi or radish or both. I made my mistake of getting too much wasabi, should have asked for it to be reduced, but I was having a great time and was trying to just enjoy it for what it was without changing the experience. Loved every minute of it. Will need to come back again in the future!!', 'positive'], [" Yasu sushi is simply amazing and elegant. People may think the price is absurdly high for an 18-course meal but honestly you're paying for the atmosphere, the experience and the extremely unique selection of sushi. They only serve about 18 guests per sitting with each chef serving up to 6 guests. It is a very personal experience where you closely interact with the chef that is preparing every course for you. The chef waits for you to finish before serving the next course and asks if you need wasabi level adjustment. The chef introduces each course and its origin. The selection of sushi was VERY unique. And I am an avid sushi lover that's been to a Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto. I HIGHLY recommend for special occasions and milestone events as the elegance is simply unmatched.", 'positive'], [" The rice appeared tinted, more than one would expect from cooking with kombu. It's possible it had some residual bran. Regardless, whatever the difference, it gave the rice a nice tooth, a noticeable umami and made the grains more individuated. Everything was near body temperature, this is the great thing about sushi that's consumed immediately after being made. Cold numbs your sense of taste, preventing you from experience the complete flavour profile. The selection of fish was incredibly diverse, artfully prepared. The chef took the time to striate each piece of fish with his to tenderize it. Nikiri was brushed on moments before consumption. The food was exceptional, bravo.", 'positive'], [" This place is located in a quiet street of Harbord, but it is located in a cluster of great places to eat including Piano Piano and the Dessert Kitchen. This is the third time I've been here, and it doesn't disappoint. The quality, however, seems to vary a bit depending on the chef. The last time I went the chef was better. We got a selection of sushi from around the world which is prepared with care and skill. You can definitely taste the difference. It takes time to thaw out the fish to the right temperature, and you can taste and see that it's done right here. It doesn't taste like frozen ice when you put it in your mouth. It tastes like rich, flavourful fish with the right amount of seasoning. One of the classics at Yasu is the three cuts of tuna, and another highlight around this time of year is the firefly squid. Sometimes there is also the shirako or the sperm of the cod, which is very flavourful! And another classic at the end is the tamago and the ice cream. You can order more pieces at the end, but remember that these are not included in the price. It is worth sitting at the sushi bar to see the chef at work moulding the rice and the sushi onto the rice. Overall, I'd recommend this, if you are really into sushi and the omakase experience.", 'positive'], [' For a long time I\'ve wanted to try Authentic Omakase in Toronto as GOOD sushi is definitely my fav food. Good being the key word here, as I am very picky about the freshness of each piece, and prefer the purity rather than added sauces or toppings. I decided to wait for my first omakase experience until I went to the motherland of sushi itself, and tried some of the best omakase in Japan just two months ago.  My wife and I could not express how incredible the experience was, and it was so good that it completely erased any craving of sushi we could have in Toronto since we just felt it couldn\'t compare. -- Let me preface this by saying before we left for Japan, we would crave any kind of sushi (buffets, foodcourt takeout) almost once a week in Toronto! But today was our anniversary, we wanted special, we missed real Umami, we missed real Sushi. So how does Yasu compare to some of the best (and I mean book in half a year in advance type of best) Omakase in Japan? Where it matters to me, the traditional pieces like uni, the tuna cuts, and other fish pieces are pure joy. A little ponzo, some light soy, simple but great; mouthwatering.  The hiccups come with some oddball choices like the baby shrimp, and sardines, and the Lobster was forgettable. However those are just some very minor, possibly taste preference nitpicks, as they weren\'t HORRIBLE, just not that good. Yasu definitely has comparable sushi pieces that rival the best in Japan, and at $135/person its incredibly worth it.  Umami definitely shines at Yasu and for Yelpers, Umami means: forgetting about the price because you are so blissfully lost in the taste of the food and already looking to find time to reserve again! Japan and Yasu has 100% ruined our casual sushi dining ventures, but because the omakase experience is so good, it makes you realize that cutting your sushi adventures to maybe \xa0once or twice a year is much better than multiple "ok" places.  Splurge a little and let your mouth splurge while mumbling YASuuu! You won\'t regret it!', 'positive'], [" It's my second time being here, always an amazing experience. - don't forget to choose sake pairing to get the full experience, why not?", 'positive'], [" Absolutely amazing experience. Wonderful staff, beautiful decor and fresh high quality ingredients. I recommend requesting bar seats if you want to watch the \xa0 talented chefs prepare every piece/dish. One of the pieces was squid. The staff had brought out an iPad to explain where the little squids were from and what makes them so special. I thought that was a really nice touch. One ingredient was cod sperm sack which really surprised me. I wasn't too sure of what the chef had said it was, which I'm glad I didn't at first. I jumped right in with no clue. It wasn't bad. I'm very adventurous and come from a background of cultures that eat just about anything so that just gave the night a interesting twist.

Sushi was ok, nothing spectacular. I've had better at JaBistro and Kaji. Try to book a bar seat if you can, we sat at the table and noticed some strange things about the difference in quality which I'll highlight below. The 3 piece we had consisting of regular tuna, light fat tuna, and fatty tuna belly was cut very poorly compared to some of the diners at the bar. The sizes were uneven and my friend had a piece that seems like it was cut and then ripped off the steak. Almost as if a child had cut the piece off. All could've been ignored if the quality was there. Also, the Uni sushi we had consisted of 1 piece of uni split into 2 for the both of us. It was no longer a speculation after the 2 pieces were joined back together to form the original piece, a fun little project we worked on. Needless to say, this Uni sushi was 90% rice and 10% uni, leaving the rice massively exposed and nothing like the photos posted on here, which took me by surprise considering the price tag on this place. Not to our surprise we noticed our fellow bar dinners received generous pieces while we pretty much ate plain rice for this course. So once again I must stress the importance of booking a bar seat when visiting as it seems like the chefs in the establishment differs in skill and standard.", 'negative'], [' I probably would have had a good experience at this restaurant but I had a horrible experience dealing with them over their cancellation policy. I don\'t remember making a reservation here at all - I think a friend or relative may have done so without my knowledge while in my home with my credit card - and despite not having even come to this place or eaten their food, I was charged $191 on my credit card! I tried to explain to the manager on the phone that I did not make this reservation and it must have been done by mistake, but he barely spoke English and told me they would not be refunding me because they "prepared fresh fish for me". When I asked to be given this "fresh fish", he told me they had "thrown it out". I am a student with tons of student loan debt, but even if I wasn\'t, it is OUTRAGEOUS to be charged $190 for a meal at a restaurant I didn\'t even get to enjoy simply because I missed a reservation. You would think a restaurant charging this much money would be able to cover their own costs of a few pieces of fish and balls of rice. I have literally never heard of a restaurant charging you money without your consent for a meal you didn\'t show up for, and the utter lack of understanding from the manager at the outset was ridiculous. After some back and forth with the guy, he\'s now telling me he can\'t do anything or issue a refund because the owner is in Japan and controls the Yelp account. Manager told me he\'s going to email owner and see if he can do anything. Maybe I will update this if anything gets resolved, but I am definitely going to dispute it with Visa if it doesn\'t. UPDATE: The owner of Yasu just threatened over email to "sue me for damages" because I am writing truthful, honest reviews about my horrible experience with this petty and greedy establishment. A restaurant that was doing well would never enforce such an unfair policy on their customers - nor would they be threatening their customers with legal action for writing honest reviews. Moral of the story: do not give your credit card to these dishonest people because they will abuse the crap out of it with unauthorized charges in exchange for ZERO services or goods rendered. Pure thievery!  I also read another review on Google where they basically did the same thing to a family that drove three hours to eat at their restaurant, were late because they got into a car accident, and were charged $300 with no explanation.

I like a pause with a knife picked up to make a single slice or one tender butterfly when I'm ready. Yasu is just efficient.

We were there at 6 PM for the "first sitting" on a Wednesday evening. There were 12 guests at an "L" shaped bar overlooking the preparation area and four of us at two tables. (Note in one case barstools are near the window at a small roundtable and the other a bench at a narrow table at the back of the restaurant. The demographics were quite interesting; the average age of the diners must have been significantly less than 30 years old, and 12 of the 16 were of Asian origin, the rest Caucasian. The demographics of the group that came in for the "second sitting" reflected very much the same demographics. There were two servers who worked in front of the bar and three chefs who worked behind it. We had been phoned two days in advance to determine if we were interested in the "Standard" menu at $80 per person or the "Chefs Selection" menu at $120 per person. We chose the former. There was quite a pause at the beginning, while the three chefs set themselves up. The guests ordered drinks. A good selection of Sakes and a short list of red and white wines. We had a glass of the most basic sake, cold - I don\'t think warm was an option, and a bottle of fine Albarino at $70. After a while the sushi started to appear two by two each time.  In our case scallops from Japan and firefly squid. We were shown a video of the latter on a laptop that was taken around to the guests. One saw them leaping about in the sea and was told they only lived for a year. They were cute but not exceptional. Next was fluke from Boston which was bland and snow crab from Nova Scotia. Snow crab is out of season, so it tasted very wilted. This was followed by Striped Jack from an island South of Kyoto which tasted like the fluke from Boston and the scallop from Japan. In a blind tasting I doubt I could have distinguished between the three of them.  There was a slight shocked look when we asked if we could have soy sauce. The answer was "no" .The only variation we could make from the chef was to add ginger. We were also told that it was strongly recommended to eat them in one complete piece. I found this rather uncomfortable on occasion.  With the Striped Jack came fatty tuna which was more like a tartar with seaweed binding and was good. Next appeared monkfish liver with Japanese mint leaf - slightly bitter, very mushy but with a rich complex taste. It was accompanied by Amber Jack which was slightly stronger tasting but not that much different from the Striped Jack, the scallops, etc. I imagine I simply don\'t have a sufficiently educated/sophisticated pallet for this. Then came three Maguro - lean, fatty, and very fatty. It was certainly interesting to make the comparison between three. The lean I found to be excellent, more like beef. The fatty was mild but more bland and the very fatty I found tough with a soft taste. Salmon egg wrapped in seaweed came next, with a mild somewhat salty taste. Its partner was sea urchin sludge, Uni from Boston, which I\'ve always found overrated. This was followed by Sea Trout which was lovely, soft, subtle and the best so far. It was accompanied by smoked Bonito which is rather like the lean tuna. Last was Mackerel with its characteristic oily and strong taste with a bit of vinegar and some radish on top. Beside it was eel, Unagi, which was very good. We were also given a Japanese desert egg dish, (Tomago?) with white fish in it and finally a small portion of black sesame ice cream. Overall, I have to say that the sushi \xa0did not "sing". One felt slightly that one was in a "straight jacket" and it was "this way or the highway " The music was very soft and one felt one\'s conversation could be heard by those all around.

I like the taste of the rice though it would fall apart unless I quickly eat it. I got 70% full after the courses but felt like we had to order a bit more so we each ordered gindara for $7 each before we could call it a night.

Good, like it  Hirame? or fluke - just ok Scallop - buttery super good and crunchy topping; thought it was squid  Hamachi or yellow tail fr japan - hamachi not my fave but this one tastes really good; the slices allow the sauce to seep in the meat Nova Scotia lobster - mind blown. The grated lime makes a huge diff, light soy sauce Fish broth - taste like any other miso soup 3 types of tuna - akame, chu-toro, o-toro, last of which is my fave but Miku's o-toro remains my best experience Gindara or black cod - van island; explosively good I smiled. A bit too much of chopped radish but doesn't detract  White shrimp from Toyama, japan - good Small bowl: ikura & negitoro - ikura not bitter; negitoro nothing special Mackerel Norway - tender and more refined taste; very good. Eat this whole. Norway trout - better than others I've tried Anago/ sea floor eel - cooked and taste like tilapia, less sauce than usual; prefer the regular unagi with generous sauce Sesame ice cream - 1 tbs, good and premium but nothing special I have been to Japan and also lucky enough to have a lot of exposure in BC's sushi scene and I feel this place is overhyped. For two people, we paid $370 total with (2) extra sushis and tip/taxes. We went for the unique experience but so far only 6pcs were new to me.

Our dinner lasted for approximately 2 hours and I enjoyed watching the 3 chefs working away behind the bar table. The items we enjoyed most included the chu-toro (fatty tuna), o-toro (extra fatty tuna), striped jack, the lightly torched BC black cod and the tamago. The 2 pieces of tuna sushi were out of this world delicious. I especially enjoyed the chu-toro, where it melted in my mouth with a fresh taste of fish oils, but there was still a bit of texture left in the bite. The striped jack had a crisp and mildly sweet flavour, it was definitely a premium cut. The tamago was a complete surprise. It was the second last course for the evening, and resembled a cake-like dessert. I was in love. Other items that were interesting included the smoked bonito, shirako and the firefly squid. In the past, I've mostly eaten bonito in the form of dried flakes, so I enjoyed this lightly seared and smoked version. The shirako (fish milt) is a delicacy from Japan. It had a rich velvety texture, and had a mild sea taste to it. I can't say I loved it, but it was definitely an interesting bite. I liked the firefly squid, it was richer in flavour than the squid I'm used to. Other pieces of sushi served included the fluke, uni from boston and hokkaido, mackerel, lobster, monk fish liver, scallop, grouper, and anago (sea eel). The fluke and scallop were not memorable, you can easily find something similar elsewhere. The uni was creamy, but I felt like it lacked sweetness and portions were very small. The taste of vinegar completely overpowered the mackerel, even the sweet daikon couldn't save it. And sadly, the lobster sushi had a bitter undertone from grating into the pith of the yuzu. These are not the types of mistakes I would expect at $135+tax+tip per head.  Overall, I appreciated the fine ingredients used and loved the premium fish served. However, we were disappointed with the texture of the rice and felt it was slightly on the tart side. When the slice of sashimi was larger, it resulted in slightly larger bed of rice, in which the texture was perfect. However, when the bed of rice served was smaller, the texture was too soft.

There was no dressing, and I tasted only 2 pieces of butternut squash. It was not filling at all, and consisted of mainly only salad leaves.

The Oven-Baked Pancake, The Heaven on Earth French Toast and a mini brunch with their self-proclamed legendary sauce and potatos. So. well. Okay. Wow. First. A Pancake is literally a Cake-like batter cook in a Pan. If you oven-baked a ''pancake'' its a cake. So be ready to receive a full size of Overcooked and flavorless cake served to you, with a side of sirup that is so existential if you dont want to eat a dry piece of cake. The Heaven on Earth French toast wear its name quite terribly, with a thick ''french toast'' serving as bread for a sandwich of cold cream cheese and berries. With so much bread, its impossible to taste any of the filling and even if you could, the block of plain cream cheese does not balance well with the berries and blend bread. Its quite unambitious. The legendary sauce is a peppery, vinaigry ketchup,overall not bad. Kinda flirting with the flavours of a BBQ sauce, it was intriguing at least for me to try to find which spices they were using.  The Rest, potatoes and eggs were merely average. Which is not saying much for such simple sides.

This restaurant gave me such a bad experience I have decided to just get this account just to write this review.  Okay first off, the food is not bad so that is great. The service and communication is by far the worse, no other restaurant I have been to was this bad. They are not only slow but, unapologetic for their mistakes. Usually I let things slide but 2 really bad experiences of the 3 times I have been is enough for me to be more than slightly annoyed.  1st experience: Was for my friends birthday party, we called in early to book reservations in 1 week in advance. Turns out they screwed up our reservation and booked us for the week after, instead of the week we asked. The only reason we found this out was because we called in 2 days in advance to reconfirm the reservation. They "changed" it but when we got there, another group got the table we wanted so we had to settle for the couches and lower tables that we specifically said we didn\'t want. Mind you this was a big group so we had 12ish people. First off they didn\'t say sorry for screwing up our reservations, they also didn\'t say sorry for putting us at the couches and more lounge area. So that is fine and all, birthday continued. We also brought a cake for the birthday girl, but only after they served us the cake they told us there was a cutting fee. They didn\'t even tell us before hand even seeing us hold the cake?!?!?! To top the icing on this cake they also had a mandatory service fee in which I do NOT believe they deserved. I am all for tipping the servers, because they really deserve it, even if they didn\'t do much. But these servers were unaccommodating and no sincere apologies were made. Needless to say we left on a sour note. 2nd experience: This experience was very recently, some time had pasted since the last incident, so I thought I would give it another shot. We called in 40mins before hand to try to make a reservation for 7 people for another birthday. They told us there was a table leaving and they could make it actually work, so happy with the quick response and "luck" we walked over (taking us 30 mins to walk over). When we got there, I told them I had reservation, they looked at me and asked if I was the one that just called. I said yes, they then quickly dismissed the fact that they said they had a table for me (knowing I called to confirm before walking over) and told me to wait an hour and there is actually not table, and that he pretty much lied to me over the phone. I wouldn\'t have been so upset if it was sincere, he didn\'t even say sorry till I started to question why he didn\'t have a table. In the end we didn\'t even end up going there to eat, which is for the better. I think this time, maybe the last time I will ever go here for food. The food is good, but not worth the crap experience of service.  In conclusion: Eat here if you want horrible service, lying staff, and a hidden "cake cutting service" (which was about $15 for the whole cake). The food is okay, but not worth the crap you have to go through.', 'negative'], [" The service super slow, the food took forever, and the food itself was pretty mediocre.

We said we were dining in and so we were advised to go sit down. All small tables in the inner glass room were full, minus 1, which me and my partner sat on, and the largest table that sat 6-8 people. The front of the restaurant with natural light was empty.

I flagged the server down 10 minutes later to ask about the status of my food. She said she will check. About 5 minutes later she comes by with the food - at this point my partner and I are ravenous and perhaps maybe that's why the food tasted so great.

We sat there for another 10 - 15mins before a waitress came, not to bring us the bill, but to tell us we could go back to the other side and pay at the counter now.

His was ok, meat portion in pasta good, sauce and flavour was nothing to write home about, did the job cuz he was hungry. Mine just sucked. Barely any mushrooms and dry chewy pasta. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate al dente, but this was, undercooked, unflavoured cardboard to say the least. Had to choke it down bc I was starving. Ordered the margarita pizza after to try to save our meal bc it looked so good at other tables, what can I say it was just meh too. Only positive was that the white tap wine was good that day and worth $1 per oz, needless to say the red was sour af and gross, stay away unless that's how you prefer your red wine then by all means, drink the vinegar.

So when we arrived on Saturday to discover that the pork belly was part of the daily special for Wednesday, I was bummed.  Looking to redeem ourselves, we decided to order the Saturday daily special instead, which was the steak for 2, but when our waitress came back and told us they had sold out it already, we were left bummed out again.  At this point we contemplated leaving because what we came for wasn\'t available, what we decided on instead was sold out, and there was nothing on the menu that I felt was worth the price they were asking. $17 pizza? $25-$30 entrees? This place seemed more like a bar and happy hour type place than a fine dining establishment. Nevertheless, we stayed.  I could see our waitress was getting angsty with us still trying to order, so we hurried up and ordered an appetizer. Seeing that there was bruschetta, we ordered that. Unbeknownst to us, this was not the traditional bruschetta that you can get at literally any and every place that offers it. You know, the typical basil, mozzarella, tomato, with oil and vinegar combo...our plate of odd bruschetta was put in front of us...I said to my friend, "did we order mushrooms?" their response was no, maybe this is a different type of tomato. So we bit into it. I immediately spit it out. It was mushrooms, which I\'m allergic to. We called the waitress over and she clarified that it wasn\'t a traditional bruschetta but a mushroom one. My only question, which I did not vocalize out loud, was "why the heck would you change something that wasn\'t bad" I\'ve never been to a restaurant and had someone say, "Boy oh boy, I really wish I could have a mixed mushroom and ricotta bruschetta because this mozzarella, basil and tomatoes just isn\'t cutting it. TLDR: If it ain\'t broke, don\'t fix it.  Our waitress asked if we would like get a different app, she told us aloud what they were and when she said "Buffalo Mozzarella" we said okay that will work. Now maybe this is our mistake for being more familiar with the idea of "Buffalo" style food meaning hot and spicy as opposed to the actual animal Buffalo, so when again our app was placed in front of us and it was just a few pieces of plain looking cheese, we instantly were disappointed realizing it was "Buffalo Milk Mozzarella" and not "Buffalo Style Mozzarella" (which is a thing by the way, and it\'s quite tasty). The cheese was just blah and for $19 I really could have cried because I was so frustrated at that point.  Hungry beyond belief, my friend was insistent that we stay. I was ready to leave and just get dinner elsewhere but it was prime time for dinner and we knew anywhere else would mean waiting again to get a table.  Finally, it was time for our main entrees. I don\'t remember what my friend got but mostly because I finished my meal in about 10 seconds, got up and started walking up the street to get my next dinner because I was so pissed at this point. Why did I do this you ask? I ordered the $18 ravioli (crazy that my entrée was cheaper than my app) and it came with literally 4 RAVIOLIS. WHAT IN THE ACTUAL HELL. They weren\'t jumbo ravioli, they weren\'t flavorful ravioli. They were lukewarm, bland, and slighty crunchier than al dente. I was fuming. I wolfed down my food, got up and left my friend to finish their meal.  I think the total came to over $80 and I\'ve never been more hungry in my life afterwards.  Immediately after leaving, we looked for a tapas style place to get more food from and made a B-Line to start eating again.', 'negative'], [' Not very friendly to a single diner.

Well, let me breakdown my/our experience as things started going from bad to worse. \xa0 We arrived and went upstairs to the "semi-private" dining area, which was their rooftop, and I guess the semi-private portion of the space was that we were placed along the wall. \xa0There was zero privacy let alone semi-privacy. \xa0Nevertheless, we were happy to be celebrating.  We started to grab our seats and I had switched from sitting next to someone to across from them. \xa0The waiter, in one of the rudest tones stated "If you are going to move around then you can\'t have separate bills. \xa0I will not be the accountant". \xa0I was completely taken off guard by his demeanor, but I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt that he just had a lapse in judgement. \xa0 The evening proceed with us all sitting down, ordering drinks and enjoying the $45/family style dining option. \xa0It included a delicious Kale Salad and the mushroom pasta was amazing. \xa0The nice thing about this menu was that in included 5oz of house wine (sold by the $ - which is amazing) or a beer. \xa0I ordered a 9oz glass to start and was going to pay for the differential of the 4oz. As the evening continued, and we enjoyed our meals and drinks, the guest of honour had asked the waiter to pass something on his way down the line to an individual. \xa0It was tough for us to get in and out due to the seating and it wasn\'t really easy to move down the aisle. The same waiter who started off the evening with a bad attitude continued by stating "I am here to take care of you guys, you take care of each other" and walked off. \xa0Fair, he isn\'t our personal courier, but come on - you are expecting a 18% auto gratuity - at least pretend to have some type of hospitality, tact and professionalism. \xa0 The evening has come to an end and we ask for our bill. \xa0Here is where the whole experience comes to the grand conclusion of errors and bad business ethics. \xa0Our bill consisted of 2 family style dining plates, 4 - 9oz glasses of wine. \xa0With the family style dining (as mentioned above) we are entitled to receive 5oz as part of the $45. \xa0We flagged down the waiter to request that we get credit for the 2 x 5oz glasses of wine. \xa0He took our bill, mentioned that the waiter must have thought we already had our wine...well after the stern talking to about moving around, I assumed my bill should be 100% correct. \xa0We receive our bill and notice an "administrative fee" - which I was aware of when reading the contract. \xa0 Now lets all take a minute to mull over the fact that restaurant charges 3% of a $2,100 minimum spend to book a table for you. \xa0For the sake of accuracy - their contract states the following "an administration fee of 3% of the minimum spend requirement, will be charged to the credit card on file upon booking". \xa0Simple math leads me to believe that 3% of $2,100 = $63.00. \xa0There were 32 of us at the table - so as per their contract and billing us individually for the fee it means each of us should be paying $1.90 to cover that cost. \xa0Gusto 101 decided that they would charge us each of us individually 3% of our total bill. After \xa0checking out the numbers - Gusto would be walking away with =/- $100 for administrative fees. \xa0So a nice pocketing of an additional $37.00 just for booking us a table. \xa0Now for the coup de grâce, Gusto decided to apply their 18% tip to the final taxed amount. \xa0As a consumer, we agree to pay a tip on our food and liquor total; however, tipping on tax (the governments money) is not appropriate in my opinion. \xa0I can comment that the tip differential is not that high, but when you add it up among everyone...it becomes a pretty nice number. \xa0I also don\'t think I would not have had a problem tipping the 18% on the tax amount if we had a server who was polite. \xa0In all honesty, the individual deserving a 18% tip was the server ruining around taking individual orders from all the other tables on the rooftop, not the rude, inconsiderate individual we had serving our table, who just plopped down one dish after another and who we had to flag down to order a drink. For most situations I like to give a restaurant the benefit of the doubt, and more likely than not give them another shot. Unfortunately, with these unethical penny wise pound foolish business practices I will never step foot in here again. \xa0I will also make sure that I advise people of the way this company conducts itself. \xa0Truly disappointing.', 'negative'], [' I honestly don\'t understand where all of these positive reviews are coming from.

We decided to try the overhyped "Mafalde Ai Funghi (mushroom pasta)" which is cheap pasta mixed with mushroom broth and cream/sour cream (yes that\'s where the taste comes from). We also tried the "Rigatoni Bolognise" which wasn\'t any better. For an Italian place there is nothing authentic about these pastas. They shouldn\'t cost more than $8.00 each especially given the quality. The Carpaccio (raw beef) appetizer was literally just that. Raw beef with some prosciutto sprinkled on top for $15.00.

We ordered steak tar tar, gusto burger and meat ball pizza and escargot. The pizza was DISGUSTING AND HORRIBLE!!!! It was sauggy, the meat balls were factory made frozen meat balls.

It comprises of culinary creations inspired by Canoe's storied past. The dishes sounded intriguing and I was excited to experience them. Reception by the hostess was welcoming. We were shown to our table, where Sarah introduced herself as our server for the evening; she was friendly, knowledgeable and professional. Pacing of the courses was fine, except for the main course, which took way too long to come to the table. The first course was Alberta Beef Tartare + P.E.I. Oysters (salsify, hazelnuts - 2002). The fried oyster was served wrapped in a very thin beef slice, over a bed of beef tartare, on an oyster shell. Presentation was unique, where the oyster shell was placed atop a vertebrae, over a deep dish decorated with greens. Sarah informed us that the creation was the result of condensing an entire full size course down to a bite size amuse bouche. While it was an interesting concept and the execution condensing the dish into a bite size morsel was well done, the different flavors put together did not blend as harmoniously as hoped. The second course was Duck 'Tongue to Tail' (dodine of Muscovy duck, foie gras parfait, quince vinaigrette - 2012). I usually prefer my foie gras pan seared, but the parfait was lovely, with a rich velvety texture. The dodine de canard also had a nice texture and paired very well with the foie gras parfait. The third course was Smoked Boudin Noir + Sweetbreads (Jerusalem artichoke risotto, black walnusts, morels - 2011). This dish had a big personality; it was earthy, nutty and delicious in an unexpected way. The sweetbread was served atop the artichoke risotto and had a great texture that resembled fried chicken, which was the experience the chef was attempting to create. This was my favorite course of the evening. For the main, guests were offered two choices, 'Chicken' Halibut (simmered oxtail, citrus veloute, Brussels sprouts, spring greens - 2004) or Roasted + Braised Hen (whipped garlic, cipollini onions, maple bacon, tarragon - 2001). The hen was described as a variation on coq au vin, which my spouse prepares very well at home, so I opted for the more adventurous chicken halibut. The halibut was flaky and wrapped in crispy chicken skin. The concept was interesting, although I did not feel that the chicken skin improved the flavor of the halibut; I found the halibut a bit too salty for my taste. Pre-dessert was Ontario Rhubarb (2014), which was described as a reference to the chef's childhood. Rhubarb pieces were served atop brown sugar. It was a refreshing and interesting course. Warm Apple Confit (quince ice cream, vanilla mousse, macadamia nut - 2000) was the dessert. It was a deconstructed dish, nicely executed and presented. Flavors were nice, though a bit subdued. Flapper Pie, closing the meal, was cute. Vegan tasting menu is available upon request in advance. Complimentary parking is available in the underground parking garage.

We came here for 2019 winterlicious in a group of 4 so we were able to try most of the tasting menu. overall amongst the starters, I enjoyed (surprisingly) the green bean salad, which wasn\'t vegan and had foie gras at the bottom which really added a extra layer of richness and flavor to the refreshing salad. For the main, my favorite was the Pork Jowl two ways and it was simply a really balanced dish. For dessert, I liked the apple cheesecake tart the most, as I really like tarts in pgeneral. Appetizers, we ordered the green bean salad, the roast beef tartare, and salmon cabbage roll. The green bean salad had a nice crunch from the beans itself, and made up for the veggies with the foie gras. My roast beef tartare was good, but I didn\'t enjoy the seared outer texture of the each piece of beef cubes as it didn\'t add texture, but did confuse my palette in a unpleasant way. The presentation of the dish also seemed off as the entirety of the tartare and the dish was on one side of the dish, which gave me the impression the star of the dish was missing. The salmon cabbage roll was a good second as the salmon was cured perfectly but it lacked texture, and the outer cabbage layer was harder to cut, and therefore harder to enjoy with the cured salmon stuffing. Main wise, we ordered the strip loin, the pork jowl, and the halibut (not about that vegetarian life). I went with the pork this year as we often get the strip loin in prior years, but boy was it a pleasant surprise. The strip loin main steak was good, but nothing stood out, the steak was cooked perfectly. The dish however did come with a beef croquette, or "osso bucco croquette", which took me by surprised as all croquettes I know of involve mashed potatoes. While it was a pleasant surprise, since the beef was already cooked before formed into croquettes and fried, the beef inside was somewhat dry and lacked seasoning. The halibut was cooked well, and it had a nice char on the outside. The sauce paired well with it, but it didn\'t blow my taste buds as much as the canoe I\'m accustomed to. The Pork Jowl however, did blow my taste buds and my mind. It was cooked 2 ways, one braised (maybe with red wine?) and reminded me of classic french cooking, and the other was similar to pork belly and was cooked similar to Chinese style Cantonese roasted pork, or siu yuk. The siu yuk was really crispy on the outside, but it was not the only component that made the dish really good. The parsnip and the heirloom carrot sauce really brought the dish together.   Dessert wise, we got the chocolate cake, the apple cheesecake, and the maple parfait. The maple parfait was delightful and the use of bananas was subtle but can definitely be tasted, and it even caught the fancy of the wife, even though she\'s normally not a fan of bananas. The chocolate cake was good, not too sweet as it\'s dark chocolate, but since I\'m not a big fan of chocolate flavored stuff, it was simply good. My favorite was the apple cheesecake, which was served in a tart shell. The little pickled/marinated pieces of apple was sweet and tarte and balanced out the sweetness of the cheesecake well. Really enjoyed that as well as the pieces of nuts on top.', 'positive'], [" We came here for the winterlicious lunch menu of 2019!

The green bean salad was pretty basic but still tasty. For entrees, I would recommend the Alberta braised beef which was spectacular as well as the albacore tuna. The chicken also had great flavour and was perfectly juicy. Finally, for the desserts, Fred put a candle on my red velvet cake for my birthday which was so sweet. The chocolate cake had an interesting (?) medicine taste at first before it melted into chocolatey deliciousness. But my recommendation is the apple cheesecake which was perfection.

Now to be fair, this review is based on the 2019 Winterlicious menu so I\'m not sure if their usual dishes are better in quality and taste, but their winterlicious cuisine was very disappointing considering this restaurant\'s reputation.  I chose the Celeriac veloute as an appetizer which was a celery cream soup with licorice. It was fine, although I didn\'t particularly care for the licorice after taste. Nothing to write home about, but pleasant enough.  My mother chose the green bean salad, which appeared to have a smear \xa0Paté on the bottom. Again, it was also just fine...but nothing that especially stood out.  For our main, I chose an alberta strip loin steak which came with sides of osso bucco croquette and mashed potatoes. The steak, while tender, was ultimately forgettable in taste. Didn\'t have a whole a lot of flavor and tasted like steaks I\'ve had dozens of times at a number of restaurants. Still, I suppose it\'s hard to go wrong with steak. The Osso Bucco croquette was possibly the best thing I\'d tasted all night. It was bursting with flavor, had a nice crispy/crunchy exterior and a tender braised beef texture on the inside.  Unfortunately for my mother, she made the wrong decision to go with the fazzoletti pasta which was a nightmare to say the least. It was a sheet of plain flat pasta sitting on a bed of broccolini and some kale which was simultaneously soft like cooked spinach, and then crunchy at some parts. But the taste....I don\'t know how to describe it, but it was overpowering and not in a good way. It was such a strange combination of flavors that I actually gagged and couldn\'t manage to swallow it. Neither of us enjoyed this pasta one bit.  Finally for dessert, I chose a spiced chocolate torte which was again, fine..very rich and dense. Once again, I didn\'t care for the licorice chantilly that topped the cake but that\'s a personal bias, I just really hate licorice. The maple parfait however, was the star of the show. It was light and airy and not too sweet, which was amazing because my problem with many desserts is that it\'s often times too sweet and rich. It had just the right hint of maple without being overpowering and complemented the candied bananas in the parfait very well. This dessert was a winner. Overall, I would say that the menu we had here was mediocre to say the least. With the exception of one dish, everything else was just "okay". There was really nothing I tasted here that was really outstanding or memorable. Many of these flavors and dishes I\'ve had in several other lesser known restaurants before. But for a restaurant of this prestige (and not to mention the price), you should be expecting more than "just okay". That\'s why I have to give this place two stars.

I ended up getting a horrible case of food poisoning/noro virus that I believe could have been avoided at a higher calibre institution that could handle a busy crowd and deliver impeccable product and service.  I could smell that an oyster was funky and notified our server. She wasn\'t apologetic and simply brought out 2 new oysters for us to replace the bad one. I was in an agreeable mood and didn\'t insist on anything further and so perhaps that was my fault. I tried to eat what seemed fresh when I should have just quit once I smelled something fishy.

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere? Philz Coffee remains my favorite coffee shop in the US, and the reason behind it is because you interface as much with the barista and his or her own specialties and recommendations as you do with the institutions itself. That's the case here at Fahrenheit as well, with barista names and nicknames on the board, high fives all around, and a fantastically jovial atmosphere that really gets your day off on the right foot. Star.  Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost? $5.10 for a medium Mocha was a reasonable price point, and everything was priced comparably down to their cookies and pastries. Star.  Stars 3 and 4: How was the food? One of the other real appeals that drew me into Fahrenheit and Philz alike is the ability to choose your bean regardless of the drink you order. As I've said before, I'm not at all a coffee snob, but in choosing between three different beans for my mocha with cool little descriptions below each, I could easily become a full fledged third wave fanboy, which is a cool feeling when it's not done in a way that's intimidating.

When I asked for extra napkins, she made a huge "sigh" and hit my shoulder with the napkins. She was sarcastic, unprofessional and annoying. By contrast, she was so respectful and patient with the white guests. We couldn\'t believe it.

This is because it\'s very cold near the front and I prefer to be warm while I eat. The other table was empty for over 10 minutes, cleared, and just needed to be set. I ask the manager with glasses and black curly hair how much longer and she replied rudely one second okay? Another 5 minutes have passed and she finally sets the tables. It\'s a long row of tables that can fit many people. She calls the person after me to go sit first then calls me and then tells me "you can go sit, I suppose." It was so incredibly rude. I sit down upset and the \xa0worker that I told I wanted to sit further away from the door comes to tell us to move down more for other people. We move down more and she asks me if I was upset because I passed up the first table and waiting longer was our choice. And we had no reason to be upset. Instead of figuring out why I was upset, knew I was upset and concluded that I had no reason to be upset. Yes, I chose to wait a little longer but their incompetence to clean up tables 15 minutes after they leave is ridiculous. And what kind of service is it to tell your customers they have no reason to be upset? Giving attitude and calling tables after me to sit first and telling me I can sit, I suppose? This ruined my experience here for life. I will never come back to a place with such unprofessional people. It doesn\'t matter if you have good food if you do not have good customer service.

We had also told the hostess to seat us at the bar if there was space.  It is easy to wait for an hour in the area, as we went window shopping at West Elm, Kitchen Stuff Plus and went grocery shopping at Longos and Metro.

We ordered the Big Brunch Skillet, the Huevos Monty and a side of pancake. The Big Brunch Skillet was underseasoned and the pulled pork was overcooked, leading to a pile of tasteless mush. My partner added a lot of salt to compensate for the tastelessness, but that didn't even do it any justice. The server was notified, but we opted for this meal not to go to waste. The Huevos Monty was at least what we expected it to be, however there was nothing spectacular about it. Beans in the middle, with some guac, eggs and sour cream.  The star of the brunch menu, certainly has to be their pancakes. However, I can't imagine eating a full stack of these unless you're sharing it. It gets very sweet after awhile, but the pancake is very fluffy. Another great thing, is that you can order one pancake on the side.

The eggs were flavorless, dry and overcooked. Salt couldn't save it. The bacon was hands down the worst bacon I ever had in my life. The paper thin bacon tasted like a bastard child of kale and broccoli. The texture of the bacon was very costco/store brand like.

Mimosa - we didn\'t order it but I think its worth talking about. For one champagne glass mimosa costs $16. We ordered their $6 drinks at the bottom of the menu which was like 2.5x the amount in a mimosa. So if you want a mimosa, make it at home, save yourself the time and trouble and money.

I've been to both but much more often to the restaurant, which will be the focus of this review. This is a great place for French cuisine, probably my favorite in Toronto. The quality of dishes has been extremely stable and decent across multiple visits in several years. I couldn't recall a single time that myself or some other people in my parties feel something is a disappointment. My personal favorite is probably the Foie Gras Terrine - that seems to be an item always staying on the menu... but I don't mind having it all the time, it's so irresistibly flavorful and smooth.  The dishes are cooked and presented in a more old-fashioned fine dining way - no fancy foam or gel. But flavor/texture wise everything reflects the kitchen staff's solid skills and great selection of ingredients. For desserts - I'm less of a sweet tooth lately, but in the past I did like their coconut cream pie that I bought one whole pie to be my birthday cake (advance notice needed though for whole pie), and lots of my guests found it very unique and tasty. A single slice of it is pretty large still, and is indeed sweet and very rich in creams. Things to notice if first time going there: The location might be a bit difficult to find. It's in the basement level of a building. They do have a sign in front of the building though. Checking map before going wouldn't hurt :) Reservation is probably a must for Fridays and Saturdays.

GNOCCHI PARISIENNE (4/5) I really enjoyed this gnocchi, although it was definitely a different take on it. The gnocchi itself was made with ricotta I believe? A lot softer than traditional gnocchi. Very delicious app to start with. STEAK TARTARE (4/5) Classic raw steak tartare, served with crunchy crostini\'s and a delicious dijon dressing. Nothing too mindblowing, but still yummy. VENISON (5/5) This is absolutely a MUST ORDER. Bacon wrapped and roasted venison cooked to a beautiful medium rare. It literally melted in your mouth. The combination of roasted beets, mushrooms, and farro sides paired nicely with the meat. I especially liked the red wine jus and mustard cream on the side. Probably the best venison I\'ve ever had. LAMB (5/5) If you like lamb, you will LOVE this dish. Again, the meat melted in your mouth and I loved the "pomegranate harissa" crust on it. The plate came with whipped chickpeas, fennel, swiss chard, green beans and tomatoes. Everything paired beautifully together. LEMON CREAM (5/5) A sweet way to end an amazing dinner!

Scaramouche did some things quite well, such as a surprisingly flavourful and well balanced amuse-bouche and a really good lamb. Some other dishes were merely OK, like our dessert. But then it failed in very basic things, like missing the cooking point of my wife\'s fillet mignon. This is unacceptable.

We started off with free bread- pretty standard. Next came the amuse bouche- a quail egg with bacon bits. This was pretty tasty. For the appetizer we ordered the tuna special with fried chicken. The chicken was very good, but the tuna was too salty for me. I expected way better given the dish was basically $25 for 2 tiny pieces of tuna and 3 small pieces of chicken.  Next came the huge and unbelievable 45-ish minute wait to get our main entrees. I've never had to wait this long in my life at any fine dining restaurant for food. When the entrees finally came out they were a pretty big let down. The lobster and halibut fish was so tough to eat that my boyfriend said his teeth hurt from all the chewing. This never happens with seafood since it's not supposed to be hard to chew. The sauce was too strong in this dish for our liking as well.

Food: \xa0favorite was the red curry (not the famous Chicken Curry one in the menu as we also has it) and the Goat Cheese Tart. \xa0The pork robs were also very tasty and enough for our table of 4. \xa0Their presentation is very solid and they take time to.walk us through each plate, including which sauce to use for which type of Satay Recommend to order 1 plate per person plus an appetizer as a starting point and go from there. \xa0It is Asian fusion, sharing style... So a good waiter like ours will make a difference in selection. We did not make it to dessert... But would have tried the house special (fruit tart).', 'positive'], [' Visited Lee Restaurant for dinner in July 2019. The tantalizing taste explosion combined with the different textures made the Signature Slaw truly a culinary delight. The black cod and pork ribs were also melt in your mouth tender and tasty. The signature Singaporean style slaw is truly awesome! The dim sums have a unique and interesting flavor. Everything was fantastic and even better then we expected. The sangria was pricey at $18 but very nice. The wine list was very good, our waiter recommended a great Chardonnay from Niagara, and the cocktails were really well put together. Yes it is pricey but definitely worth that bit extra! Service also e excellent with friendly and knowledgeable staff.', 'positive'], [' OMG what an amazing culinary experience \xa0The staff worked really well as teamwork \xa0They were passionate about the food and cared about your experience.

The Tuna Two Ways was SO GOOD! It's tuna tataki ceviche with two tuna tartare tacos... SO DELICIOUS! I'd go back just for that.  The Char Siu Duck Breast and Confit was also so good - the duck was so flavourful and tender.  Susur Lee's famous Slaw is a must-try as well - I like to share it as an app. \xa0It has crispy bits, has tons of flavour and the perfect amount of dressing. Shared this with two others as an appy! I can't wait to go back and try Lee's dessert :)", 'positive'], [" This is one of my favorite places in Toronto. I've only been there once, but I cannot wait to to back. The chef has created an amazing eclectic menu of American and Asian flavors. We started with the 19-ingredient slaw salad, which was gluten free. It was a nice little show to start of the meal since they toss it table side. Then we had the hamburger spring rolls, which surprisingly tasted like something I've never had. Then we had the slow braised short ribs, and ended with the duck dish. All in all, one of the most amazing meals I've ever had. The menu is also very large, so there's something different to try every time!", 'positive'], [' Was visiting from out of town and this place caught my eye while doing some research. I am so glad that I came here. Fantastic location as well so you can plan other activities before or after coming here because there is so much to do in the area. Ordered six dishes for two people and it was definitely one too many dishes. They may not look big but they are pure quality and filling. Four would have been perfect for two people. The Wagyu beef sushi, Singaporean slaw with Wagyu beef, and Luckee Shrimp Cheung Fun were just out of this world. Each bite had such a wonderful burst of flavor. Everything was good but the pulled beef tacos and curry roasted chicken were my least favorite. The ambiance is easy on your eyes and enjoyable.

A bit pricy but so worth it for the experience!', 'positive'], [' Totally amazing service and good from the beginning to end! Staffs are very informative with the menu and recommendations. Especially Chole who was our waitress and was very easy to speak to. The must try to begin your menu would be Singaporean style slaw which was very simply delicious!!

We're from Philadelphia and came to Toronto to eat here. Obviously, we're huge fans of Susur and even his sons. Chef was there cooking in the back but we didn't want to bother him for a picture given how busy the restaurant was. (Sad ) The restaurant opened at 5 and our reservation was for 5:15. By 5:30-5:45, the whole restaurant was almost packed! I believe our server was Amy...(I forget) but anyways she was amazing! She explained everything on the menu to the last detail. I must say, everyone who works here is definitely trained to a T. Everyone knew exactly what was being served and each time they served it, they told us what it was. I was really impressed. Even with the 19 ingredient slaw. So yeah the service? A definite 5! On to the food. I decided to do the tasting menu (they call it the journey) because chef Lee made it based on his recent travels. It's a $98 tasting menu.  From the slaw to the last item (dessert) everything was so amazing. I will add photos and the menu so you can see what it consisted of. My boyfriend ordered the duck and ribs as well. The duck spread was amazing! I'm used to the traditional Peking Duck with bao buns and hoisin sauce but they gave it with a thin pancake, pate, hoisin, two other sauces, and all these other concoctions I can't name. lol! It was so yummy! The ribs were HUGE and very soft. I also got the oyster shooter while I was there because why not? I must say it is a little pricey but with the service and the food, it was worth it. Ohhhh I cannot forget the tableside sangria !!!!! The best sangria I've ever had hands down and they make it right in front of you! With fresh fruit and edible flowers, even my bf loved it! I would totally recommend coming here. It was such an experience. I really loved the service, it made the food that much better. Here are some pictures!", 'positive'], [" Simply put--fantastic, and delivered on the hype.

My fav place in Toronto!', 'positive'], [' Probably one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto! Most recently I came here with some friends for Winterlicious and it was fantastic as usual. The service is always impeccable and the food is divine.  A signature cocktail was being carted around and served tableside, and although it was not to my personal taste, it was certainly fun to watch.  Because we were there for the first day of Winterlicious we got a surprise amuse-bouche course -- a pork croquette with crispy kale. Croquettes in general can often be dry, but this one was good! My choices for the prix fixe were the Organic Penang Chicken to start -- cooked perfectly and also just a beauty on the plate with its highly technical execution; and then the Adobo Braised Beed Curry -- the beef was certainly the star of the plate a with melt-in-your-mouth quality and great flavour. The final course is a dessert trio that was surprisingly well-balanced. My favourite was actually the little cake with pandan syrup. All in all this was another fantastic experience at Lee and my love for Susur lives on!', 'positive'], [' Finger licking delicious food. Very innovative dishes and well presented. Absolutely loved the Singapore slaw. Great service from our waiter.', 'positive'], [" Lee was amazing! The service was impeccable, every server seemed very knowledgeable about all the ingredients in each dish as they dropped them off and were very attentive to detail. The flavours were super unique and absolutely delicious, they worked amazing together! The restaurant itself is beautiful. Overall a wonderful experience.  Singaporean-Style Slaw (5/5) - Obviously a must-have as this dish is what Chef Lee is know for. Super fresh, amazing flavours, and great presentation as they mix it at the table for you. 19 different ingredients and they all taste great together. I'd love to try this slaw next time with some raw salmon or tuna sashimi.  Spicy Crisp Tofu (5/5) - I loved how perfectly crisp the tofu was, with a delicious soya chili glaze on top.  Cheese Burger Spring Roll (5/5) - Wow these were SO creative. A spring roll stuffed with burger meat and aged cheddar with pickled slaw and chili mayo all in a lettuce wrap. Another must order! Sambal Satay (2/5) - Honestly after all the amazing dishes we tried before, this was disappointing. The chicken was a bit dry, the beef and shrimp were nothing special. The three sauces it comes with did not help either.  Signature French & Chinese Tong Yuen (5/5) - This is definitely a must try for dessert. This was kind of like a two part dessert - little rice dumplings with a delicious berry compote and pastries that have a sweet vanilla filling inside. Such great flavours, I've never tried anything like it. Dessert Trio (3/5) - We loved that we were able to pick three desserts off the menu to try. The Mango & Passion Fruit Panna Cotta was probably my favourite as it was the least overwhelming, I enjoyed the mango mousse and it came with very interesting toppings on the side (black rice pudding, some sort of rice crisp) but honestly it was just okay. The Chocolate Peanut Butter Bar was a little too rich for my liking, but if you like rich chocolate and peanut butter, then you'd love it. The Warm Molten Chocolate Cake was also very rich, and nothing special.", 'positive'], [" Honestly I can't even think of words to begin this review. This restaurant is simply AMAZING. From the moment I entered, we were treated with incredible service. We arrived 30 minutes early for our reservation, and the manager personally took our drink order to enjoy while we waited for our table. The dim lights and ambience of the place made it easy to relax and enjoy dinner. Its a large plate sharing type of restaurant where a different server brings out each dish and describes it to you. We ordered multiple dishes and they even switched our plates and utensils between each order so as not to mix the flavors! The hostess was pleasant, and service was nothing short of what I would expect at this type of place. 5 stars from me!  We ordered a total of 4 dishes to split between 2 people, which was a good amount because we were so hungry! If you're not really hungry, then 2-3 dishes shared between 2 people would be ideal. We of course ordered the 19 ingredient signature Singapore slaw, they bring it out in a huge tray and toss it in front of you - the server even let me take a picture of the salad before he tossed it haha! The salad itself was incredibly satisfying, the dressing was perfectly seasoned and the salad itself was light and refreshing which is surprising for 19 ingredients! We also ordered the goat cheese tarte which was delicious! The third dish was shrimp and lobster ravioli, 8 could honestly eat this ALL DAY LONG! The shrimp itself with the garlic sauce was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth. As a shrimp enthusiast, I make sure to always order the shrimp dishes, and this did not disappoint. It was definitely one of the best shrimp dishes I've ever had. Lastly, we ordered the Top Chef Curry Chicken dish which is the winner of top chef. I honestly don't think I've ever had such perfectly cooked chicken, with a crispy thin skin. The chef recommends that you eat each bite of chicken with a piece of grilled pineapple and try the different sauces - mint with a spicy sauce and a coconut curry sauce. Honestly words cannot describe how delectable this dish was, I could eat this every single day of my life and not be bored! Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant and it's experience to EVERYONE, at least once. The one thing I have to add is that it is quite expensive, around $20-$40 per each entrée, so if you're on a budget I recommend trying 1-2 dishes and to make reservations for a special occasion! If not the dishes we ordered, there is definitely something on the menu for everyone!! This place gets 5 Stars from me. I will definitely be back to try everything else on the menu!", 'positive'], [' I made a reservation days beforehand for 4 people for 6:15pm.

I asked if we could sit at the area by the wall with the cushioned seats and she said coldly said "no". I told her that we will be leaving shortly after an hour - since I knew exactly what I wanted to order and we had plans later. She again said "no that\'s where you\'re going to sit" and was very rude and condescending. After we were seated, she threw the menu on the table and left without saying anything. By the time we left an hour and a half later, more than half of the cushioned seats were not filled. This is also not the service one would expect from a meal more than $200.

What made it so ridiculous was that the restaurant was three quarters empty.

The food tastes decent. But the prices are ridiculous. And the service is so pretentious with the resume described for every dish and everything being called a "signature" dish.

I had some tofu dish that tasted ok but at $18 I\'d rather drive to Bhai\'s Indian Canteen and have an entire meal that tastes way better and costs way less. Their $18 sangria has no taste of alcohol in it just a mug of juice and fruit. Stick to the beer! And we must have had over 8 different people serving our table instead of just having one person care for our table which would have made for a more pleasurable experience. Oh and the woman leading us from table to table as they tried to figure out which table was ours kept mumbling instructions to follow her inaudible into her collarbone.

Everything from the service to the food to the way the place was running seemed off. When the hostess walked us into one of the dining rooms, she warned us that the floor was slippery in there. This strikes me as the perfect encapsulation of what\'s wrong with the place. We know the floor of our restaurant is slippery enough to warn people about, but we\'re keeping this floor! Cocktails were very weak. The sake-tini had bits of something (edible flower?) floating in it. We got the oysters, which were a special. From PEI. They seemed a little past their prime, as did the grated horseradish. The famed Singapore slaw was too much for two people. And I don\'t see what\'s so great about it. It\'s just bite after interminable bite of the same flavor/texture. Ours had too much of the sickly sweet beet dressing on the bottom. And when the server "performed" the mixing at the table, pieces were flying out of the bowl ending up all over the table and on our serving plates--and they were left as is. A theme for the night began: the servers extolling the virtues of the food, raising expectations too high. Going on and on about Susur Lee\'s reputation. The next dish--crab croquettes. Four medium sized croquettes, on a large oval plate too big to fit on our tiny table. Why such big plates when your two-tops are this small? Also, our server took this dish away when there was still one croquette remaining. Not cool. For our second round of drinks, my friend ordered a martini (not off the cocktail menu) so I decided to also order a margarita. The server looked confused and said "we don\'t have any of the slushy stuff." And I was like, that\'s not what I want. I\'m just looking for a classic margarita, on the rocks. He responds, "so just tequila with some lime?" He rushes off (throughout the meal he was distracted and other employees were constantly getting in the way). I decided to avoid paying $18 for a mess of a drink so I flag him down and ask him to change it to a bottle of beer before he puts it in the system. I wouldn\'t normally do this, but I was already over this place. Then they bring out our last dish--except it\'s the wrong dish. It\'s the braised beef. We had ordered the "Top Chef" green curry chicken. Our server had gone on and on about how it was a great choice, and a winning dish for Lee. He even repeated the whole order back to us. It must have just been an error on his part but combined with the other things it was very annoying. When the dish arrived, it was so lackluster I couldn\'t believe it. The dish on the menu has about a million ingredients listed in it but absolutely none of them came through. Bland on bland! The plating of the dish was also knocked over by the server when it was put down on the table. And the bill came to...$198 pre-tip. Ouch. That hurt. We go to restaurants all the time (both high end and dive and in the middle) and I\'ve also worked as a server, so I don\'t think our expectations were unreasonable or over the top. It was a major waste. Not enjoyable in the least. Won\'t be going back. There are much better places in the city (Buca, to name a nearby restaurant) with a better dining experience.

The pieces of egg were great too! Must try if you go there, albeit it's on the pricey side. We started with the lobster miso which was something different for me. The miso soup had a nice flavour, and the lobster was perfect and surprisingly easy to get at and eat. Normally I'm not a fan of lobster, but I'd have this again. Finally, I'm not sure which it was either the Ebi Oshizushi or the Salmon Oshizushi, the Oshizushi were phenominal. I had no idea what I was missing with blowtorch sushi, but now that I've discovered it it's up there as my favourite.  Everything was good but the above really stuck out. If you have a special occasion you want to celebrate with a few close friends go here, especially if you like sushi.

We were first served the aburicious rolls, but I felt like they should've served the sashimi platter first because the aburicious had more of a heavy flavour if that males sense.

We get greeted by the hostess, nice lady, acknowledges our reservation and takes us to our table. (Interesting I thought to myself, she did not ask if we wanted to check our coats or bags as they did the first time, Meh i said, it wasn\'t a big deal)  We sat down, looked at the menu and contemplated what to eat. 10 minutes passed, and after receiving a phone call from my parents that they were going to be late, we decided to indulge in a drink, however not a glass of water in sight. So we waived down our server, and as he came by, he dropped 2 glasses of water.  We ordered a 10oz Sake he had recommended, even had a little taste test before we ordered it, not bad. The restasurant was getting busy, so we decided to order incase we had to wait, and most importantly we were really hungry.  Finally my parents arrived, 7:40PM now, they are brought in and seated at the table, my dad sits down, however, the hostess asks if my mother would like her coat checked, absolutely she says, then goes on and asks my dad if he would like his coat checked, walks by my Partners Coat, remember its a coat, not a sweater, shrug, nor a little skimpy cardigan, a full size coat; does not check it. (fine, as it wasn\'t a big deal) My parents sit down and we talk about their day, 10 minutes passed, no water in sight, we sit there sipping on our sake, with 2 glasses of water for 4 people. I look at our server who walks by, he looks, smiles and nods, OK. 5 minutes later, still no glass of water, so I decided to waive him down and ask for 2 glasses of water. First two dishes arrives (complimentary Lobster miso soup) which comes with the Lobster sashimi platter we ordered along with the IKA we ordered. Soup was ok as it was free, my partner had a tough time taking out the meat, I told her, mostly because the lobster is over cooked, no kidding, it was so overcooked it tasted like rubber; good thing we didn\'t pay $5 for it or I would\'ve shot myself in the foot.  Immediately after the soup, they change our plates, cleared the table and brought our third dish, (4 pieces of O-toro sushi). Without a doubt, O-toro was amazing, melts in your mouth. After the O-toro is when the waiting game began.  By now it was 8:15PM, we had finished our first 3 dishes and I had drank my cup of water. 8:30PM, my glass is still empty along with my partners. 8:40PM, (after almost 30 minutes) finally someone comes by and fills our water glass ( I didn\'t say anything as I still had sake but FAAK..) and brings out our lobster sashimi platter. I must say for the price, and it being a "large platter", I have definitely seen better. Regardless, the sushi was pretty fresh and it wasn\'t bad. Downfall; we found a piece of fish scale on one of the sashimi.  We finish the sashimi platter, expecting our last 2 dishes to come out at the same time as they were Nigiri and a Roll (Jabistroll), but nope, they refuse to bring it out.  9:15PM, finally the Jabistroll comes out..without the Nigiri. Fine, Jabistroll is suppose to be their signature, but fk..the roll was soggy, the rice was soggy, when you pick it up with your chopsticks, half the roll crumbles and falls on the table before it makes it to the plate. There was more rice on the plate itself than in your mouth. You put the roll in your mouth, you taste the sear and then everything turns mushy like baby food. FML! I waited how long for this? and it was suppose to be bomb? After the Jabistroll I figured they would smarten up and bring me the Nama (classic 7 piece nigiri) but again, nope, didn\'t bring it out. 9:45PM finally they bring out the Nigiri our server says thank you for your patience, by that time I had already zoned out, Inside, i was so frustrated, nothing wouldn\'t recovered my dining experience unless a miracle occurred.  I decide to order dessert due to the occasion 10PM The dessert comes, I was hoping it would be something fancy, you know like a plate with crazy design of coulis with aerated chocolate or something. BAM, nothing, just 2 stemless martini glasses, 1 of the vanilla ice cream with asian pear, the other of some sort of coconut Sake with strawberries, and a plate which said HAPPY BIRTHDAY, with a scoop of green tea ice cream and a green tea creme brûlée. No candle, no nothing, just a plate that says happy birthday, like something you would get at loblaws when you ask the lady to write happy birthday on a chocolate card and she gives you all sorts of excuses how she can\'t do it, or you have to write it on a piece of paper so she can do it. Best part is, after all this waiting, I ask for the bill and NOTHING is taken off, not even the dessert, nor the Nama which took an ice age to arrive.

The sauce had a really great flavor as well. Nothing to complain about Carbonara Katsu - This was my favorite. I really liked the creamy sauce with shrimp and whatever else they threw in there. I'll be getting this again forsure Brick Cheese Katsu - This was the one that had my mouth watering when i seen it on the menu. I did think it was just fried cheese. But when it came out I could see that it had meat on the inside too. I think it was pork. Regardless, it was damn good. Maybe a little too much cheese. But it was fine. Very delicious. The place was kind of small. But it was really clean and well kept inside. One thing i really like in places is when you can see into the kitchen. This was how it was in here. Idk what it is about watching people prepare your meal. But it's just more satisfying for me. Service was nice. Our server was on top of everything. We had everything we needed.

Upon taking my ramen order ($14), the server told me our table needed to meet the sales revenue target the restaurant had set for each customer. As we were a table of 2, we had to spend at least $20.

We were told no, despite the fact that there were other empty tables and it seemed clear the back table was reserved for a larger group.

Instead it was put together with the table next to it... for a table of three! After reminding the staff that we were waiting for the extra table, we were told that was not possible. So the five of us were forced to squeeze into the same small space as the three beside us. Common sense would have been to give us the extra room, and put an extra chair at the other table. This was not what prevailed. There was no apology or reasoning with the person who was clearly in charge.  Things get from bad to worse: when asked to speak with the manager, we were told there was none.

The food was mediocre at best with astronomical prices for what you get (more on that to come, but spoiler alert, don\'t ever add a blueberry pancake to your order). We had breakfast there this past Monday- atmosphere was good, cute decor, and our server was very nice. The menu is HUGE, which was exciting, lots to choose from covering both breakfast and lunch.  First up, my friend got the Yolk around the clock (a bagel with an egg in each hole and cheese on top) and it was fine. Not bad, not great, the potatoes were good and you get two small pieces of fresh fruit. But that dish should have clocked in around $10, not $14.  Second dish, my friend ordered an omelette. Which was a decent size, if a little thin, but again the lyonnaise potatoes were good. Here\'s where things got crazy. You can add a single pancake onto your meal for $3.75, which honestly is already a ridiculous price for some batter (and it wasn\'t even a big pancake, not even as big as my hand), but my friend asked if it could be a blueberry pancake. The waiter said yes, they can put some blueberries on top. That was it, no mention that this was a special request and that this was an upcharge. When the bill arrive, HE CHARGED HER $3 FOR BLUEBERRIES. Let me stress this: THAT SINGLE PANCAKE THE SIZE OF A FEMALE HAND WITH A FEW BLUEBERRIES PUT ON TOP, NOT EVEN BAKED IN, WAS $7.75. I was in the bathroom when they paid and my friend is not confrontational and only told me afterwards, otherwise I would have absolutely said something. That is literal highway robbery and shame on staff for not mentioning the extra charge on top of the extra charge.  I\'m pausing for a moment so that $7.75 charge for a single pancake add on can truly sink in.  Finally, I ordered the waffle grilled cheese, which was just a total disaster. The menu says, and I quote: A comfort grilled sandwich made with bacon, fresh pears and mounds of cheddar cheese melted between our traditional Belgium waffle". Mounds of cheddar cheese huh? There was a SINGLE SLICE of cheddar cheese melted on each side of the waffles, which were huge, THICK Belgian waffles and so it basically absorbed the cheese into the bread and I couldn\'t taste it. The pears were just sliced- not caramelized or cooked in any way and thus felt so out of place on the sandwich. Grilled cheeses should also be just that- grilled. But the waffles were soft and soggy. There was absolutely no crunch. They just took a waffle, melted a slice of cheese on it in a microwave, and put some raw pears and bacon on it with a small \xa0handful of fries (those on the other hand were quite crispy- so hard they scratched my mouth) and charged me $13. It was awful. To top it all off- just avoid the drinks here. $4 for fountain soda. A FOUNTAIN SODA. The mimosa was $9, in a champagne flute (tiny) and was so dark orange I truly doubt there was any champagne in it.  That meal cost me $21 before tip.

The service was special and is worth mentioning. The staff took care not to serve us too much food or wine. The bartender had an awesome eye for pacing the meal and poured more and less wine based on our comments. Several different staff came from the kitchen to deliver plates and share more about them. There was an almost intangible attention to detail here that is truly rare to find. It was comprehensively a fantastic evening and the best way to spend our last night in TO.

We booked a table for 6 back in early April and got a reservation mid-June. The full party arrived at 8:30pm but we didn't get seated until 8:50pm, which annoyed me at first.

Our table got the tasting menu and the wine pairing. Half the table substituted the lamb for wagyu (+$65) and added cheese before the dessert (+$16). Everyone enjoyed the whole experience.

The reservations are taken up very quickly. Look online to see when they open and call right when it opens.  Location: At the corner of Queen and Spadina. Slightly hard to find due to dark paint around the door and the name of the restaurant is engraved into a dark sign.  Price: Tasting menu in the dining area $135/person. Deposit for reservation $50/person. Paid 3 months in advance when reservation is made. Mixed drink ranges from $10-20. Wine pairing is ~$80/person. We had the option to upgrade our main course to wagyu beef for $65/person.  Food: Every dish was amazing. The amount on each plate was small but the food was elegantly made with so much care. Each sauce or garnish was bursting with flavour. They were also very creatively plated, so it was like eating delicious art.  Service: The service was also exceptional. Two servers would come to our table of four, and use coordinated motion to set the plates. It was like watching a performance. Another waiter would fold our napkin if we went to the bathroom. They were all very polite and helpful.', 'positive'], [" I understand why this place is always hard to get a reservation, and why is rated number 1 in Canada.

They even follow you when you go to the bathroom so they can open the door for you.  Our table were facing the window, so I asked the waiter if he could close the curtain, a few minutes later, he told me that his manager would not let him close the curtain. I guess it's ok to have customers eat while having sunlight in their eyes. The waiter was very nice, and offer a complimentary drink since he felt bad for not being able to close the curtain. It's not his fault, he was just following orders from his manager. Very hard to appreciate your food or have a conversation when you have sunlight in your face. The food were delicious and beautifully plated with an attention to details. A few dishes were a miss for us since it was too salty. The desserts were pretty good.

Located on the first floor is the offshoot is Alouette which caters to lunch crowds and easy dining. Also need reservations but you can do this on the same week or do a walk up with an easy wait time of 2 hours. Need to book months in advance for Âlo though. Their online reservation gets updated in the beginning of each month but it is in high demand, it is usually already booked by the time you get on your computer. They don't accept walk ups. Also regardless how you get in you do need to makes prepayment to keep your reservation: from $50 per person for fine dining in the dining room or $165 per person sitting bar style facing the kitchen. The later is an extended fine dining! There is a very long waiting list. The dining room's fine dining is a 9 course French extravaganza. You can also have a wine accompanying your meals with different wines and cocktails but this is extra. We opted for the Czechoslovakian red wine, there most affordable :( The service was impeccable. We've been to a lot of exclusive restaurants but this one was oceans apart especially the service. From the receiving host at the front bus persons , wine experts, maitre'd, waiters. We were celebrating our birthdays and all employees knew about it and greeted the celebrants. If you asked for their names, they would say their whole name. Say what? The unisex washrooms are situated near the bar (yes there is a bar section for bar flies only more easily accessible- fun fact) one of the employees would run ahead of you to open the sliding door for the toilet for each patron.

Not only is the food incredible, but the attention to detail, the professionalism, the knowledge of the staff just wow'd us. You can tell that a lot of thought went into creating a unique experience starting from the moment you step into the restaurant.

When we were seated, our server came by and again wished us a happy anniversary. I swear we were there for only 5 minutes since entering the door and we were already greeted by 4 members of the Alo staff.  We got complimentary bubbly and an incredible app to go with it. I honestly don't even know what it was but it was incredible. It was a bite size wafer that was delicious. The oyster was topped with olive oil, dill, and some kinda mayo. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Our favourite dish of the night was the green curry, kanpachi, mango, lemon verbena. Who would have ever thought that kanpachi would go so well with green curry. It was so refreshing.  The cuttlefish was also a big hit with us. The texture was so perfect, almost scallop like. There was a brush of pistachio purée that complimented the fish. I've never had anything like it.  The wagyu ribcap was out of this world. You can never go wrong with wagyu dressed with some truffle butter. I'm getting so hungry right now! Honestly, it is a bit pricey at Alo, however it's well worth the price for special occasions. It's an experience that you must try at least once in your life. The food is beautiful, like works of art. The drinks are good, the old fashion is a must get by the way. The service is top notch.

We were really disappointed with the treatment and had to finish our very expensive meal at the bar. If they wanted us out in 3 hours, they may have considered serving us faster or letting us know we are not allowed to get up from the table. And to top it off, the next morning both my partner and I woke up at 6am not feeling great at all. Both our stomachs were very unhappy with us. Our friends told us they both had stomach aches.

The bar menu is concise, but uninspired. It almost feels like they know their bar guests were not able to reserve, so they can be treated as lesser guests.

Unfortunately until end of all the savoury dishes both of us were still hungry. So we received three courses of dessert which made us think we are kind of full for at least 15 min because of all the sugar.  We paid $110/person only for the food before tax & tip.

Overall I\'d like to give this place 3.5 stars but Yelp doesn\'t allow half...Anyways, here is the review. The bar experience was what made me tempted to try out the full tasting despite the difficulty of making reservation: each dish we ordered tasted great though the portion was small, but this was a bar after all...just get a second order if something is too good. Cocktail was pretty tasty even though I was later less of a fan for alcohol. After a month we were sitting in Alo again, this time the dining hall. We arrived at 6, not too late a time for dinner. Then the dinner started, amuse-bouche, cold and warm appetizers, vegetable dish then some fish...but each dish was small and I started to notice a problem: I was feeling hungry, so hungry that I couldn\'t focus on tasting the food...Where is the bread?! Bread came right before the last meat course (wagyu beef) but it was too late already. Most of the meal has passed and I was only thinking of how to swallow the food faster to fill my stomach. I still don\'t understand why the meal was arranged that way, even a small piece of bread to tackle the hunger would have helped greatly. From what I could remember, some dishes tasted good but nothing being mind blowing delicious. Some dishes had element that I didn\'t understand (what\'s the point of having those white colored, tomato flavored foam?). Desserts were too sweet and dense to my liking. Service was not the type I liked the most - staff cleaned the table frequently but sometimes too frequent that made me felt interrupted during conversation. Ironically the dish I enjoyed the most was the buffala cheese platter. But for cheese platter I\'d give the credit to the quality of ingredient itself more than to the cooking staff. Hopefully what I experienced was an occasional miss as they do change their menu seasonally. But if this was indeed a true reflection of the standard of the "#1 restaurant in Canada", then I\'ll have to call it a disappointment.', 'negative'], [' *Review for Bar Room* Our experience can be summed up in one word: fine. At many fine dining establishments, the lounge area is quite representative, though more approachable and relaxed, of the overall concept. At alo, they are night and day. In the dining room it\'s jackets and dresses in a luxe environment with finely tuned dishes. In the bar room, it\'s t-shirts and jeans in a cramped quarters with more basic offerings.  Overall, the food was neither memorable nor offputting. The food leans heavy and hearty, lots of sauce, cheese and fat. I get it, this is a bar room. The bar room menu simply does not captivate and showcase the prowess of the kitchen. It is truly a different concept all together. The website could do a much better job informing guests of this difference (i.e. more than the understatement "many guests treat the bar room as a restaurant unto itself"). On our visit, we tried: - Château de Bourgogne (sesame honey, fried onion, sourdough - $22): Quite enjoyable, creamy and smooth cheese. Liked the honey aspect, and sourdough was a natural complement. Recommend. - Ricotta Agnolotti (parmesan, sourdough crouton, chili - $24): Rich and creamy - not a lot of perceptible flavor beyond the cheese filling. Good, if basic. - Bone-In Veal Chop (king oyster mushroom, yukon gold potato - $45): Moist and decent exception, but lacking punch and interest. - Cauliflower (cheddar sauce, marcona almond, chili - $14): Nice little kick from the heat but nothing special, quite a hefty dose of cheddar sauce. Just ok. - Brussels Sprout (double smoked bacon, kimchi, pickled daikon - $12): Well executed; kimchi is not overly done. Balanced and enjoyable. Nice camelizarion on the sprouts.  - Canele ($8): Seemed overcooked and overpriced. - Rhubarb (labneh, orange, campari - $12): Very creamy center, nice texture and the rhubarb lent an offsetting tartness, well balanced. A highlight was certainly the cocktail and wine list. We enjoyed several of the cocktails, including: Ballroom of Mars ($18), Pine to Palm ($15) and Turf Club ($16). The cocktail list is extensive and included options across the range from classic to adventurous. Wines by the glass list was well selected; a number of good reasonably priced options, including the Domaine Rolet Cremant du Jura ($19) and 2015 Turner Pageot \'Le Rouge\' ($18) which we enjoyed. My advice: if considering alo, go to the main dining room. The bar room is fine for a casual drop by, but not worthy of a special trip or advance reservation.', 'negative'], [" Really wanted to love Alo, but it was just missing in all different areas that I struggle to understand why it is being hyped as the best in the city.

Highs: I was overall pleased with the food, the presentation was perfect and very creative. \xa0 Lows: SERVICE - nothing about the service was immaculate or impressive. My whole experience was littered with a bunch of mistakes that really should not be happening at a restaurant like this. We waited 15 minutes past our reservation time for our table to be ready. No apology was offered by the staff - as if we should be expected to wait after arriving on time for our reservation. I was hoping to get over the less than ideal start to our meal, but we ended up being unattended for another 10-15 minutes before we were greeted by our waiter and brought drink menus. Not a great impression so far.  Throughout the course of the meal, we were asked a total of 4 times of any dietary restrictions by different people. The answer was none. Don't ask repeatedly if you are not going to write it down. \xa0 I did not really enjoy the dessert, so pretty much left it untouched. My server did not seem to care and cleared the plates without batting an eye. He happily and swiftly brought me the bill. When the credit card machine came, the first screen I see is the tip amount. I was not even shown how much my credit card was being charged. I had to ask what the total was after the deposit made online. This is completely unacceptable. On our way out, of course another mishap. We were given the wrong jackets, and were promptly given the correct ones, but no apology was given.

The batter, which is part of why I love this place, is sooooo flaky and light. Doesn\'t feel heavy or oily at all. Size of the shrimp was also pretty substantial. Nowhere does it say so, but it\'s what I\'d call "jumbo". The whole thing is fried to perfection, crispy outside batter paired with plump and succulent shrimp. I dip it in their tartar sauce like I would fish, but that\'s just my typical irresistible urge to dunk fried foods sauces.  Now onto the "chips". Their regular hand cut fries are pretty decent, but I usually substitute for sweet potato fries. Again, super light and crispy outside, then soft inside, paired with chipotle mayo. (I\'ve also tried their onion rings, which became my one and only, however tiny, disappointment with Freso\'s. It\'s breaded not battered. For a place that has perfect fish batter, they breaded their onion rings... sigh) Overall though, this place is a winner. Massive portions. Super chill environment, oldies music, excellent service.

The food came very quickly - I ordered the small special lanzhou beef noodle with extra thin noodles and my mom got the braised beef tendon with thin noodles. Both dishes had very salty broths, the braised beef had a weird and overly salty flavour, and the thin noodles in the second dish was undercooked. It tasted like stale dough. When this was brought to the waiter\'s attention he stared at me blankly and went to talk to the kitchen staff. He came back, only to tell me "they say its cooked". I tried to explain to him that I was aware it was cooked but that it was UNDER cooked and tasted like dough, yet he kept repeating it was cooked. When asked if it could be cooked longer he said no. In disbelief, I asked if they were just going to serve us undercooked noodles (I mean, it would probably give the consumer a stomach ache). At this point, another waitress comes by and takes the dish away from us. I would have expected them to at least replace it with a new, properly cooked dish but maybe my expectations are too high? They walked back and forth with the dish only to return five minutes later telling me once again, the noodles are cooked. I can\'t even.  We ate maybe 25% of the food and walked out. Some of the most unhelpful and ignorant servers I\'ve dealt with.  I feel like people are just hyped about this place because you can watch the guy at the front hand pulling the noodles, but if you\'re familiar with the noodle pulling technique you would notice he\'s not doing it properly. He slams the dough not nearly enough times, which is what gives it good texture/elasticity.', 'negative'], [" Awful service attitude!

But aside from the food I have to say customer service as well as sanitation was extremely awful. Because the front door of this restaurant is always open due to the restaurant\'s popularity, I found myself surrounded by the occasional flies, mosquitoes, and fruit flies. A fly managed to dive into my soup during my time here, and I told the waitress about it. I honestly didn\'t want to be unreasonable and cause a scene so I explained to the waitress about what happened since I had planned on taking the remaining half of my noodle soup home... Not only did the waitress accuse me of lying about the fly, she also refused to acknowledge that the fly was in the soup when she brought it to my table (which I had never claimed was the case, I told her a fly went into the soup), she also said it happens all the time and I\'m just supposed to accept that there will be insects in restaurant quality food. "There is nothing we can do," she said multiple times. And then I told her I wasn\'t going to pay full price for the lack of care and sanitation the restaurant refuses to acknowledge. With some back and forth, they were only willing to give me 20% off of the noodle soup I\'ve ordered, and I barely consumed half of the order when this happened. So this was definitely not a good experience for me and I\'m quite disappointed at how they handled the situation. Normally in other restaurants they would immediate replace the contaminated food, but I honestly didn\'t expect them to argue why they shouldn\'t have to have the standard duty of care when it comes sanitation and clean food. I also am well aware that I am responsible for my own food, but as a restaurant they should definitely also acknowledge that proper insect and pest prevention should be in place. So for those of you that want to try the place, the food was definitely authentic and good.

The bread was very good, the meats and cheeses were just fine. No complaints but wasn't amazed either. We also ordered the patatas bravas with boquerones & morcilla. The waiter ended up getting my order wrong and brought out regular patatas bravas.

The sandwich seemed to be more bread than filling and that's a real problem for a place that specialized in Sandwiches.  I'm sure I'll get a lot of flak for this next comment but I'd almost say you'd be better off going to Subway.

Instead of ala-carte, I tried the Kinkalicious menu last week. It's their take on the long-running Summerlicious, where they offer a set course meal for an affordable price. It's a great way to sample the menu without breaking the bank. The 8-course menu offers a range of popular dishes that can be shared among friends and is only $29 per person (minimum of 2 people). If you're not into a tasting menu, then you will find that the menu offers a variety of traditional and modern specialties made for sharing. Course #1 - \xa0We started our meal off with the Gomaee, which was blanched rapini in black sesame sauce. The black sesame sauce really added a nice kick to the veggie dish.    Course #2 - The second course was the Sashimi Platter. It was beautifully plated and came with a variety of fresh fish. Thickly cut too!  Course #3 - Gyu Shabu Salad Course #4 - The third course was the Angus Beef Yukke, which was angus beef tartare topped with scallion, raw quail egg yolk, and nori. It was a dish that I would never order as I don't eat raw beef, but my friend really enjoyed it.  Course #5 - The Fry Platter was my absolute favorite of the night! It consisted of the three items that I always order whenever I am at a Kinka Family establishment including Kinton Ramen. Their gyoza is one of the best I've ever had, especially with the accompanying sauce. The takoyaki was plump and wasn't overly battered. Course #6 - The Kakimayo is very popular amongst diners. It's baked oysters with spinach, mushrooms, garlic mayo and cheese. A deadly (if you're lactose intolerant), but a yummy combination. Course #7 - Next up before dessert was the Kinoko Bibimbap, which is a hot stone with rice, mushrooms, cheese, and seaweed sauce. It's a vegetarian dish, and you can mix it yourself or ask one of the servers. This dish was really good! Course #8 - We ended the night off with a scoop of Matcha Ice-Cream. Nothing special, but good.  Kinka Izakaya also offers an everyday set menu with 10 courses for $35 per person. Overall, Kinka Izakaya is a very solid izakaya option in Toronto.

How KINKA isn't jam packed between noon and three is a mystery to me, but one I ultimately have little interest in solving. Knowing I can walk into KINKA on any afternoon and have an affordable, delicious, thoughtfully conceptualized lunch box without having to wait a minute in line is a joy I carry with me constantly. That being said, It also feels like a crime that more people aren't aware of this.  The concept is simple - it's a bento style meal (plus soup) where you choose 1 food in four 'categories'. I've been making a point of eating less red meat and more fish, which means that my path to success is clear: sashimi salad, octopus takowasabi, grilled mackerel, and salmon don. Trust me when I tell you that everything I've listed tastes phenomenal. Having all of that on one plate is mind boggling - even more so when the bill comes. $13 pre tax and tip. That's it.  As I mentioned, everything is delicious. The dressing on the sashimi salad combined with the crunchy fried garlic and peanuts is a perfect compliment to the sashimi itself, the takowasabi is gooey, strange, spicy, and perfect. The mackerel - served with what I think is minced radish with soy sauce and lemon - is yummy, and the salmon don is super fresh (gotta love that salmon roe too).  I'll sum it up this way: as Toronto becomes more and more expensive, I've been on the lookout for things that make it worth the cost.

First, I called the restaurant and asked if we would be able to spilt the bills and was upfront that I would not be able to pay for 1 single bill, after talking to the person over the phone they said it was okay and to just "please show up." After seeing reviews on yelp I decided I wanted to confirm and I sent the restaurant a message on yelp even saying we would all be willing to pay an automatic 18% tip. Kathryn from the head office called me and let me know that to accommodate for a large party we would all have to get the $40 set menu and she would figure out with the restaurant if we would be able to do drinks separately for each individual. She ensured me that this shouldn\'t be an issue and she would get back to me in a few hours...she never got back to me so I called her and gave her my email and I have yet to hear back. I decided to call the the restaurant again last week and they mentioned that yes it\'s okay they can do that for the bills and not to worry about it. For some reason I had an unsettling feeling so I called again tonight, apparently I was speaking with the manager and he said it\'s company policy and they cannot spilt the bills...potentially only 4 ways, which still does not work for my party as there are different couple, etc.  Many of the people in my group didn\'t even care for the food as they prefer more Canadian traditional food but were willing to pay for the set menu just for the experience. Our whole party was even willing to do the 18% automatic tip. They told me they would only know when we get there if the restaurant is busy or not but I am not willing to take that risk.

Birthday cheer - GREAT It's loud and fun when the waitresses gather to sing happy birthday.

The fried chicken karaage was very bland, while the sukiyaki tasted sweet as caramel. There seems to be no moderation.

We waited for 5 minutes, and had to ask a different waitress to take our orders. But since it wasn't her table, she had to go find the original girl... A lot of running in circles. 2. Ready time.

The music is what's the loudest, and then the customers must also shout to hear each other, so everyone is breaking their vocal cords and ear drums. In essence, you can only shout to the person immediately beside you. No one else at the table can hear you. OVER-PRICED Keeping in mind this is an izakaya, the small portion sizes do not justify the costs. Between 7 of us, $150 barely counted as snacks.

It was not a bad choice! I'm really picky with my bbq sauce, so this was a risky decision for me, but it did not disappoint! It was simple enough, yet was bursting with flavours. The twist is the bun, I think.  This area is amazing - so take your sandwich to go, and discover the interesting houses on Gibson and Roxborough!

Unsurprisingly, both sandwiches were cold and did not have the toppings we asked for, such as, the double horse radish with the BBQ sauce (as recommended by customers). To our fault, we proceeded to finish the sandwiches without raising our concerns.  However, we decided to get a third one to identify if they were providing us pre-made sandwiches. Just as quickly as the first time, immediately after ordering we received it -- and it was simply a hot mess just like the first time. With this in mind, in all likelihood Black Camel has pre-made sandwiches sitting around to give to customers, hoping individuals would not express their discontent.

Second, a sandwich served with cold bread and hot meat is not cool. Why don\'t they take 10 seconds to even warm up the bread??

It's like putting hot tomato sauce on a bed of cold pasta. Meat is tender but lack in taste. For all you southern BBQ enthusiasts, the beef doesn't come in sliced form, rather it's completely shredded. Not the southern tradition, but it's okay since we aren't in the south.

However, I found myself dreaming, and wishing, for Phil\'s sauce with every bite, just to be sorely disappointed each time.  The bread had an odd taste to it, almost overpowering the meat at times, but there was more than enough meat to stop it from happening too often. The service was quick, but the place is so small that the people ahead of me pounced on the odd free seat - forcing me to sit out in the cold. Again, I don\'t have a problem with this in some places, but knowing I could be in the warm confines of another was just another disappointment.  The sandwich was a little pricey as well. For the same cost, I could get a sandwich, albeit a smaller one, with a wonderful side of beans elsewhere.

They always sell out super fast though so make sure you get there early before noon!", 'positive'], [" Adamson Barbeque is located in an industrial area on Wicksteed Ave south of Eglinton between Laird and Don Mills in Leaside. This area for now is notorious for traffic. \xa0For Don Mills, the Ontario Science Centre, Sunnybrook Park and the fact that Leslie is closed because of the saga of construction that has besieged this area for years now I'm sure this hood can't wait until the Eglinton Crosstown LRT is finally complete. \xa0Still, one place no doubt is unaffected as far as demand for their product goes and that place is Adamson BBQ. \xa0For a place that basically is operating 24 hours a day and mostly behind the scenes, what they create pretty much lasts for only a few hours in a window that for the most part is inaccessible for most. One does not simply just drive down to Leaside, walk into Adamson BBQ and walk out with whatever BBQ goodies they want. \xa0With smoking and preparation of meat being an around the clock process the results of this intense labor of love is what you have to this day which is lines of people willing to go to a place that spends copious amounts of time and energy preparing succulent meat for the masses or at least those lucky enough to lay claim to a daily portion of what may be available for them or otherwise place an order in advance. \xa0 For pre-orders of meat most items are sold by the pound except for beef ribs and sausages. \xa0Brisket, turkey, pork ribs, pulled pork, all sold by the pound are sold at different prices with brisket being the most at 30 and pulled pork being the least at 16. \xa0Beef ribs are sold in racks at 90 and sausages are sold individually. Being that pick up orders are the safest guaranteed method to get food from this place (also you have to leave with the catering, no eating pre-ordered in the restaurant) it's the sure way to get a some of that precious meat. \xa0We had decided to pool resources together and one of our friends pre-ordered and did the pickup of our order in which we later shared at Sunnybrook park at a picnic on a perfect summer Sunday afternoon. Collectively we had 2 pounds of brisket, 2 pounds of pork ribs, 2 pounds of turkey and a pound of pulled pork. \xa0I had an extra pound of brisket on the side just for me which I brought home to my wife who was extremely happy. \xa0The eight pounds of meat was in the neighborhood of 200 bucks. \xa0Having sampled a bit of each meat this is how I found each: -The turkey was a bit dry but it's not their fault since it's turkey breast which is dry in general. \xa0The smoked flavor coating is there though and it's distinct. -The pulled pork was good but then again I'm not the biggest fan of pulled pork. \xa0Out of the sampling we had pulled pork is probably the easiest to simulate and least time consuming process if you had to make it yourself without the entire smoking process. -The pork ribs were very good. \xa0The full size side ribs were long and had an acceptable amount of meat on each. \xa0I ended up with just half a rib because ribs by the pound is sort of a bad bang for the buck model. \xa0Let's be honest, most of what are ribs is actually bones and the meat the bone ratio at best is a coin flip when it comes to meat to bone ratio in something sold by mass. -The brisket is king, the king and the crowned king if I had to compare it to anything else available in Toronto. \xa0Not that smoked brisket is a common food item here as there are some BBQ joints in town but having sampled many of them I have to say among the places I've been (Smoque N Bones, Cherry Street, Barque, etc) that Adamson has the heavyweight title of the center of the universe (for those that don't know, that's the term of endearment given to Toronto by those that meaningfully call it as such). This brisket is the reason for wanting Adamson BBQ in your life as far as I'm concerned. \xa0This brisket is not only juicy with the perfect consistency, but the taste, the smoke, the balance is next best thing to perfection. \xa0A Royal Flush cannot essentially convey how straight to the Ace this brisket is. \xa0It's an experience to say the least. Just for the brisket alone this place in my humble opinion just triumphs and has a halo. \xa0Where there's a rainbow, at the end of that rainbow is a platter of this brisket. \xa0 Generally speaking Adamson recommends half a pound to a pound of bbq per person when attempting to properly size an order for catering. \xa0With having brisket this good I'd almost recommend getting a pound of brisket for each person for just the brisket. \xa0Everything else is good but I really feel that the brisket shines above the rest. \xa0It makes we wonder what a rack of beef ribs would be like at this point.", 'positive'], [' Best bbq in Toronto.

Well, it was certainly not the food because I never got a chance to try it and after what happened, I doubt I ever will.

We got there just after noon - they opened at 11:00 and the place was packed.

When one member of our party took to FB to voice his disappointment over the long wait and the amount of tables, he got a reply which included, "too bad you are above waiting in line." First off? How rude, arrogant and insulting. This is NOT how you address a complaint from someone who was ready to put down a good chunk of change to eat at your restaurant - and after reading some other reviews, overpriced - \xa0and secondly? Two members of the party were DISABLED and to ask them to STAND in a line, for an hour was strictly out of the question.  Perhaps the very tactless people at Adamson\'s should consider this possibility before hitting the keyboard to accuse potential customers of being "above standing in lines."

That just sucks.', 'negative'], [' Disappointing. I tried this twice and my conclusion after two visits is that the barbecue here may well be "the best in Toronto" but IMO sure the hell ain\'t anywhere close to St. Louis or Texas. The brisket: only the outside had a weak smoky flavor and the inside had the taste and texture of boiled beef. (I actually don\'t mind boiled beef, but that\'s not why I came here!) The ribs: these were a bit better, but also kind of so-so, again, not very smoky. Sides: coleslaw and cornbread are good, kale Caesar so-so and cost extra (why?). \xa0In the end, the level of satisfaction does not match the price tag.

I arrived 20 minutes before opening time and got the last parking spot at the front. There was already a long line of people waiting, eager to enjoy the barbecue experience at Adamson. This time I ordered a plate with two sides (corn bread and beans) and three meats (double brisket and pulled pork). The problem started when we got to the meat counter; I noticed that the brisket looked very dry compared to what I had during my first visit and decided to talk to the person serving the meat; he acknowledged that the brisket did not have much fat, but he would only serve me a better brisket with more fat if I ordered brisket by the pound, not as part of a plate. He informed me that they cannot afford to serve the better brisket when customers order by the plate, and did not budge. I hoped that the brisket would still taste good and decided to not be difficult; unfortunately I came to regret that decision. The brisket was not tasty and totally forgetful. I had to apologize to my friend for bringing him to Adamson for such a disappointing meal. The pulled pork was fine and corn bread was tasty. It would had been nice if the food was served hotter (temperature wise). During this visit, there was a band playing at the back corner. While it was a nice idea to have live music in the venue, unfortunately it was too loud and we had a difficult time carrying on a conversation.', 'negative'], [" Coming from Texas, I really wanted to love this place... I've been to a lot of great BBQ joints in Texas (Killen's, Black's, Salt Lick, Hard Eight, Pecan Lodge, Lulling, City Market, Louie Mueller's, Franklin's, Hutchison, etc...) so I've been looking for great brisket in TO for some time now. Adamson looks, feels, and smells like a typical BBQ joint in Texas and the meat looks, feels, and smells like Texas BBQ... but after visiting 5 different times expecting different results, I've concluded I'm not a fan, although I can understand why others love it as it really is hard to find good BBQ in TO. Here are the things I think need to be improved on: 1) Way oversalted. BBQ is supposed to be salty, but the Bratwurst and the brisket here are by far the saltiest BBQ I've ever had. Need to ease up on the rub. Texas BBQ is typically just salt and pepper. Couldn't taste the pepper cuz there was too much salt. 2) Cutting brisket properly is almost as important as cooking it properly. Every time I've gone, the guy up front is more concerned about getting the weight correct instead of slicing the brisket correctly. So to get the weight correct, \xa0they cut off odd shaped triangle pieces, paper thin slices, half slices, and brisket that is cut along the grain... Juices run out and meat dries out as a result. 3) The smoking wood mix here seems to be more pungent than Texas BBQ. Typically in Texas there's a lot of post oak and pecan used. 4) For some reason, their brisket is dry when you eat it... It looks really moist when they slice it, but it's really just the rendered fat. The actual meat is dry when you eat it. I've had the point and the flat here and multiple occasions and still found it dry. 5) Sides need some work. I see they chop their brisket for the pizza joint next door. They need to save some of that for their beans (see Jack Stack BBQ in KC) Typically you also get a stack of white bread, pickles, and onions for free in Texas with your BBQ. Helps clean your pallet a bit and keep things from getting too one dimensional. Should do the same here.", 'negative'], [" Food (which wasn't sold out): Chopped brisket and pulled pork were fine, but nothing special. \xa0I've had better at Big Crow and Kaplansky's. \xa0The Jalapeno sausage was good (but also no better than many Toronto establishments) but the smoked turkey was excellent. \xa0The beans were very disappointing, very little flavour to them (Big Crow is far superior). \xa0The coleslaw and potato salad were nice, but nothing to rave about. Service: Much of the food was sold out after my 40 minute wait. \xa0There was no warning about this, just announcements of what was sold out as it happened. \xa0The chef recommended several other options to us and was helpful - however, the cashier refused my girlfriend and I separate bills (which was odd), and when we couldn't finish the large amount of food the chef recommended, the cashier refused to give us take out containers (part of their policy I suppose). \xa0 Overall: I understand what this place is trying to do, (I have been to similar BBQ joints in Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana) and I did not come in expecting a fancy atmosphere or to be coddled as a customer. \xa0I'm sure I should have come earlier (11am was recommended and I arrived at 12pm) - however, the whole package did not add up for me. \xa0 I understand that food sells out, but some sort of warning would have been appreciated.  And if they don't offer a take home container, that should be mentioned at the cashier (or warned by the chef who suggests a large amount of food).

When the store opened at 11am there was a short wait. You get your sides first and then move onto the meat. We got the macaroni salad and the potatoes salad. Both were decent but lacked flavour, and was a little bland. They also give you a side of onions and pickles with the sides. Next you move onto the meat section. We got 1/2 of pulled pork, 1/2 pound of beef brisket, one sausage, and quarter pound of ribs. They also give you complimentary bread with your meal.  You don't think it's a lot of food when you are ordering but it fills you up a lot. The total came to about $65 for two people.  There is quite a bit of seating but have to order first, get your food, and then sit at a table. Everything is self serve, including their bbq sauce, water and utensils.  The pulled pork was a little dry and lacked taste. So we had to use a lot of their side bbq sauce in order for it to be flavourful. The sausage was standard tasting, the ribs and the brisket were the winners. They were both melt in your mouth tender. If we go back, I would only order the brisket and the ribs.

Nothing has come close, and maybe it's the expectation driven by the hype around Adamson up here in Toronto that lead to a bit of disappointment. Make no mistake this is good barbecue and I love how successful Adamson is, but if you're looking for something to compare to Franklin's or Black's or Pecan Lodge you're not going to find something identical here at Adamson.  Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere? Well they've certainly got the atmosphere down. Visible smoker aside this was as if I was walking into any BBQ joint in Texas from the menu to the setup to the meats and sides offered. The people behind the counter couldn't have been friendlier, and I found myself laughing out loud as my assigned brisket cutter was talking to the cut of meat as though it was his significant other. Star.  Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost? You can get meats by the pound at Adamson that are comparably priced to what you might find in any other slightly expensive city (Los Angeles, SFO, etc.), but as I was really only here for the brisket I went with a $15.00 lunch plate that included two sides, which was a good deal. Star.  Stars 3 and 4: How was the food? While the optics and attitude were all there, the product simply wasn't the same, and I'll start with the brisket. You can google Franklin's Barbecue brisket or Pecan Lodge brisket and what you'll find is genuinely at times a quarter inch of 'crust', that is, the flavorful smoked salt and pepper casing around the cut of brisket. That's where brisket is made or broken, and my first little tinge of disappointment here was that the crust around my cut of brisket, and the associated flavor, didn't quite compare. Additionally, the brisket didn't really have that distinct smokey flavor that you'll find elsewhere.  Regarding the sides - they were fine, but I was a bit surprised to not see a hot mac and cheese option, and the pinto beans were slightly undercooked and also without that smokey flavor that comes with mixing a bit of brisket into the beans as is common elsewhere. At the end of the day a lot of this is just personal preference, but my experience didn't quite align with what was sky high hype. Single Star.  Star 5: Would you be excited to go back? Adamson Barbecue is doing great business here in Toronto, but my quest for brisket comparable to Texas outside of Texas continues. No Star.", 'negative'], [" Adamson Barbecue is located in a poor location. Industrial area east of Leaside that is very unattractive. The restaurant has no a/c and it is very hot inside. There are fans but they don't help out that much with the temperature. If you make a platter to share, you have to eat your food on a piece of paper. I'm not sure why they can't provide paper plates to their customers. The cole slaw was way too creamy, it was practically a soup. The meat was tasty but some of it was quite fatty. The best meat, the brisket, is a bit pricey at $30/pound. Adamson might want to consider providing an alternative to sugary soft drinks with their meals. Coffee or tea would be a decent addition to their menu.

The food tasted good and my turkey was juicy. My bf really enjoyed his brisket. After our main course we decided to get some dessert as well since I've heard good things about their baked goodies. We asked the guys at the counter which dessert they would recommend and they both told me that the nanaimo bar pie was incredible....lies. It was all mushy and honestly one of the worst desserts I've had in my life. It did not hold together well at all...I honestly make better nanaimo bar pies.

I was expecting to be blown away when I ate their food and I was not. My fellow diner who has had eaten American BBQ (though it was in SF) said it was not as good as he has tried.  Regardless, I would highly recommend giving Adamson Barbecue a try. Review: Let me caveat that I have not had many legitimate BBQ experiences where the restaurant/joint doesn\'t grill the meat to an inedible char. I prefer BBQ that is smoked. I would definitely come here instead of going to the rib fests in Toronto.  A year ago while browsing the web, I discovered Adamson Barbecue. I couldn\'t believe the rave reviews - especially for a restaurant was only open from 11am - 2pm. Now, they are opened until 8pm. A year later, on a Friday evening, I finally ventured, with two other diners to try. I was pleasantly surprised that there was no line.  Order: 1) Three meat platter ($28 after tax): Rib, brisket and turkey with tangy coleslaw and fancy pickled vegetables Rib: \xa0Best thing I tried. Their choice of rib is excellent. As it IS NOT the baby back there is a substantial amount of meat. As they offer Texas BBQ, apparently this style of BBQ does not rely on sauces and it is seasoned heavily with black pepper. The black pepper definitely comes through but it isn\'t overpowering. The rib was tender but didn\'t disintegrate after biting into it - all good signs. The smoke was subtle and not overpowering. I would definitely get this again.  Brisket: It may be because I received the end of the brisket but I was not a fan. My pieces were not from the centre of the brisket. The pieces had a lot of fat on the top and bottom. As I ripped off the excess fat (how could I?!), the seasoning went with it and I was left with tender meat that was not as flavourful. Also, one of my fellow diner\'s found the brisket to be a tad salty.  Turkey: I saved this for last and it may not have been the best choice. To me, this had no flavour and this may be because my taste-buds were coated with the heavy flavours from the other meats. I would definitely skip this - or maybe try just one piece before anything else. Tangy coleslaw: This was average - I was expecting more of a "tang" Pickled vegetables: This was solid - definitely will get this again.  Bratwurst ($5): Solid sausage all around with the best snap I\'ve ever tried. It is very meaty. \xa0  2) I also tried a bite of my diner\'s pulled pork. The pulled pork was tender. However, as it does not come with sauce (note, they do offer a sweet and spicy sauce, but I found it too spicy to use), there is not much flavour on its own. Next time, I will eat the pulled pork with the tangy coleslaw or pickled vegetables. I would definitely get this instead of the turkey.  3) Chocolate cookie ($2 before tax): It is a decently sized cookie. It would be great if the entire cookie was chewy and not just the centre.  4) Oreo cheese cake: This was tasty and not too sweet. The filling is not hard like New York cheesecake. 5) Butter tart: Fellow diner ordered this and I had a small bite. It is way too sweet for me. It\'s like eating (sweet) caramel straight.  Parking: There seems to be very limited parking in front of the restaurant which also shares the space with a pizza joint.  Note: They sell beef ribs on Fridays and Saturdays, but they normally sell out early. I believe they also offer burnt ends on Tuesdays and pork belly on Wednesdays.', 'negative'], [" Visited this spot for lunch after hearing rave reviews about it from some coworkers.

I didn't even come here before as my cousin bought a whole pan to a holiday dinner and my oh my, even reheated it stood out from 4 other cakes on the table. First of all I think it was the variation in texture that made for an interesting mouthfeel. It has a crust but also a moist and bouncy inner bready body, kind of like bread pudding. There were also parts that were fluffy too. It also wasn't too sweet. A lot of Christmas desserts are just sweet throughout, and with the apple cake it was just the embedded apple bits.

Fake crab meat with real crab?  Once finished, waited for awhile to get the check. Waitresses were always around since I was at the bar but making drinks or filing up water. I tipped 15% as the service was normal and nothing spectacular. Their default is 20% which is absurd when you should expect service on par to it.

It has fried prawn, avocado, spicy tuna, and deep fried unagi, but you can barely taste anything but the tempura batter and the avocado because it's such a mess of rich flavours. The Spicy Scallop Roll was also a bit of a fail. I saw it a couple of times while scrolling through photos posted for Saku, so I thought I would order it. It's tempura scallop bits with spicy mayo. Waaaaay too rich, and it was soft and mushy too. It could really use something like cucumber to lighten it up and add some texture variation. The Tuna Avocado Pressed Sushi was a little better. It's cooked tuna and avocado pressed with sushi rice. The thing is, there's something strange with the rice here. It's seasoned like sushi rice, but it's long grain like jasmine rice, and doesn't have as much chew as sushi rice. Anyway. This was pretty good.

The caramelization on the crust is so delicious, it gives you a taste that's hard to put into words.  I ordered the pepperoni for my first time. They do have other selections, but the simple pepperoni pie is a good pizza to start with.  I've tried many styles of pizza in their hometown (Chicago, New York, Naples, Rome) and this pizza is a life changer. YOU MUST TRY IT!", 'positive'], [" Detroit pizza in Toronto ?!?! HECK YEAH ! This place was amazing ! I still have dreams about it ! I swear ! I have never tried Detroit style pizza before but this will never be my last! My favorite is the caramelized crust. The No Name got our attention with giant dollops of ricotta cheese and Mikes Hot Honey !! After coming here, I bought mikes hot honey for now all mY pizza needs ! I can't emphasize enough how great this pizza is. It's a small location with very friendly staff. Overall highly recommend!", 'positive'], [" OMG!!! This pizza was packed with so much flavor!! I ordered the Jaffna and I was Extremely skeptical because it seems that I had never heard of such flavor combinations before. BUT, after eating it I know why, Because there is NOTHING like it. It was amazing. It definitely provides to much outside of your usual vegetarian pizza option and I definitely had enough to eat for two days! Customer service here was also a plus. When I'm back in Canada, I'm coming straight back to Descendant!!", 'positive'], [" I've gotten a table there once - we normally do take out. It's absolutely delicious and unlike other pizza I've had. It's heavy so be prepared to eat - \xa0you also won't eat as many slices as you normally would on a thin crust pizza", 'positive'], [" The pizza was delicious and filling. My husband and I got both ordered a small (4 pieces) and we only ate 2 each. We should've shared! We had GATT-Daddy and No Name. Both were good but the No Name had a little kick. I got the hot honey on the side because I don't like really spicy food", 'positive'], [' Did I not review this yet?!? It\'s been a couple months since I was last there but I can still remember the taste perfectly. Even if you\'re not a typical fan of pan pizza, they may make a believer out of you. It\'s very much "fork and knife" pizza and each piece has to weigh a couple pounds, yet (for me) it still goes down easy. We went with the \'No Name\' pizza. The ingredients (from the website) are: cheese blend, Ezzo pepperoni, house made fennel sausage, sauce, post-oven ricotta dollops, Mike\'s Hot Honey, fresh herbs, pecorino, calabrian chilies. If those ingredients sounds good, I can tell you that paired together in person, it\'s even better than you\'d imagine. What still stands out in mind memory was the sauce mixed with the chilies and the hot honey and then tempered with the ricotta.  It\'s clear that they not only put emphasis on good ingredients, but there\'s a lot of thought put into pairing them together. Based on what\'s listed for the Jaffna pizza, I\'m dying to try that too and I wouldn\'t normally be clamoring for a vegetarian pizza.  Such a shame that it\'s pretty far for me, but I still need to find my way back here soon...and back again. If the prices seem high, note that not only are they using great ingredients, but two slices really is a large portion. Split a large 3 ways and you\'re only spending about $12/person.', 'positive'], [" HOLY SH*T! This pizza is incredible. If you haven't tried it you must go. Go fast. The crust is absolute perfection - thick and fluffy but crispy and delicious at the same time. I've been about 4 times thusfar, and each time is consistently delicious. 1) Pepperoni - cheesy, cup-shaped pepperoni, delicious. 2) Special of the day - wow I wish this one was permanent, it had white barbecue sauce, pickled onions and braised beef; I'd say one of the best pizzas I've had. The space is small with few seats, not sure if they take reservations, we've usually walked in at obscure times and been able to get a spot. The one time I went when it was super busy was about a 20 minute wait, but worth it. I do see ubereats/foodora drivers coming in so you can order it through that too. Not cheap at all, but definitely filling and worth it in my opinion. Also, it takes a decent amount of time to get the order as they make it on the spot.", 'positive'], [" I really enjoyed this pizza restaurant. It has a nice vibe and delicious Detroit style pizza! Great menu that doesn't overwhelm you.  I went when it was freezing cold outside so it was quite nice to have a hot slice of goodness in my belly.", 'positive'], [" Friend of a friend recommended it and make sure you go there with an appetite! The atmosphere was great and the decor appealing. We did have to wait for about 30 minutes for the food to arrive but the restaurant was busy and the pizza needed time to cook. The food arrived and couldn't wait to dig on. We barely ate one slice and we were already talking about the next pizzas we would buy when we go back!  The prices are reasonable for the size of the dish. A small pizza can feed 1-2 people if you have a small appetite or order an appetizer. Big appetite? You can eat that small pizza (shown in the pictures all to yourself). The restaurant is small and fills up quickly so be sure to reserve a seat, or simply call in your order in advance and take it to go.", 'positive'], [" Came to Toronto on a hunt for some pizza, can never go wrong with Detroit style pizza! Corner piece is the best  I was unable to go pick it up so I used UberEATS for it to be delivered to the convention center. If you order deliver takes about an hour which isn't too bad.  I ordered a small pepperoni and small gatt-daddy (Italian sausage) , which was 4 pieces each. Pizza was still warm upon arrival and was very good! Crust was crunchy and cheese was still cheesy.", 'positive'], [' This place is seriously the bomb! When we came we had to wait 45 minutes for a table because the place was so tiny but we sat at a nearby bar and had a few drinks while we waited. The wait was totally worth it. We each got 3 small pizzas and although they were pricy they were very filling that I barely ate half of mine! I had the pepperoni one and although it was delicious the pepperoni was a bit too salty for me. However, my bf and friend each got the Gatt Daddy which was AMAZING. Next time, I will get that one minus the sausage since I am not a fan of sausage. The interior vibes of this place were good - they played a lot of retro music and our server was super friendly and had excellent recommendations. Overall, I highly recommend this place and hope to return in the near future!', 'positive'], [" Ended up at Descendant Detroit Style Pizza because of a recommendation from a friend and it was so worth it!! Got there around 4:45 on a Sunday and the place was full, FYI it's not the biggest space, they can probably fit around 20-25 people max in the restaurant. Luckily a couple was leaving so we got a table almost instantly but anyone that came in after us were put on a wait list and told how long it would be, they also take your number and then either call or text you when it's time to come back for your table. But it's definitely worth the wait!! They also take pick up orders if you don't want to go and sit in the restaurant or wait for a table.  My friend tried the whiskey beer and I got the cola that they have in store and they were both awesome!! Now let's talk about the pizza!!! They have two sizes, small (8x10) and large (10x14). The small has 4 square slices and the large has 6 square slices. Since there was two of us we got 2 smalls so we can try different pizzas.  Our one pizza was called ELECTRIC AVENUE which had jerk chicken, fresh pineapple, curried lime aioli, green onion, Mama Lil's Peppers, Diablo's Fuego hot sauce (first picture) and our second pizza was the special that they had, which I forgot to take a picture of the description but it had mushrooms and sausage and truffle sauce. They were both so good but the electric avenue I think was my favourite!! The pizzas are nice and deep but not so much that you feel like you're only eating dough and they are all generously topped with lots of the ingredients, they don't shy away. The fresh shaved mozzarella on top was a great touch!!!!  We were definitely full after eating there and if your going on your own a small is perfect and a large would be great for leftovers for the next day.  I definitely want to go back and try all their other types of pizzas that they have (8 of them)", 'positive'], [' Really good deep dish pizza. \xa0I ordered the No Name pizza and my friends ordered the Funghi Truffle Pizza. \xa0Both were really flavourful. I highly recommend just ordering a small. \xa0It was perfect for two people. If you want more pizzas, keep ordering small so you can taste a little bit of each. I ordered the No Name pizza because the server said it ha the most meat.  Service was amazing. We never had to call for our waiter for extra water or utensils. They are really professional and kept refilling our waters before we finish. \xa0They provided excellent service and were very nice. \xa0 One thing I would critique would be to get better knives. We had to cut really hard to cut into our pizzas. Our pizzas were not pre-cut.', 'positive'], [' One of the tastiest and most enjoyable experiences I have had at a pizza place  Staff are awesome, very accommodating and the pizza was delicious - rich and filling, with a nice crisp crust and not overwhelming in ingredients.

And the art in the place is out of control!', 'positive'], [" Gourmet Pizza out in the east end. Far from Mississauga - but I will make this trek any day (not during rush hour of course) My girlfriend LOVES pizza, so after seeing so many reviews about this particular place on yelp, we just had to try it. As we got here - a fairly small restaurant, maybe 30 people max in there? The menu is pretty big - as there seems to be something for everyone. Serves you half a pie or a full pie (half ranging from 18-22$? to a full which comes to about 35$) - A little 'pricey' but for gourmet pizza, it is DEFINITELY worth it. We ordered the Truffle-Ghi as we love truffles. This is a white based pizza.. and let me tell you; TRY THIS IF YOU LOVE TRUFFLES! It was SO delicious, and we ordered \xa0a half and couldn't even finish it. The size is maybe comparable to a Large pizza from Dominos, but much more dense in terms of quality of cheese and toppings.  Definitely give this place a try if you are a pizza lover!", 'positive'], [" So good. This place is no frills, sit down and have a Detroit style tray pizza for yourself and a beer or two. To me, this is better than the monstrosity that is Chicago style pizza.  Maybe a half inch to an inch thick and , they offer a wide array of different toppings, offering both red & white style pizzas. Topped with fresh toppings and different drizzled sauces for extra zing (depending on what you choose) the pizza comes out with lots of melty cheese and a crispy greasy crust reminiscent of pizza hut pan pizza except crispier and greasier! Easily split 1 amongst two if you're not too hungry, but do yourself a favour and get yourself one whole thing and treat yourself because yolo", 'positive'], [' Crispy edges, generous dollops of sauce on top, and great overall ingredients make it my favourite pizza in Toronto! The only "downside" is that you really have to come hungry or cool with taking home leftovers as the pizzas are pretty filling. My favourite is their sausage with peppers. I\'ve had a few of their pizzas, and the amount of meat is always a tad underwhelming if you really like meaty pizzas, but the combinations of flavours and ingredients just can\'t be beat.', 'positive'], [" Detroit style pizza is what Chicago's deep dish pizza should be: crispy from so much oil that it's virtually fried, with caramelized cheese all around. And Descendant is truly what pizza dreams are made of. Unfortunately, it's not cheap, but it sure is fulfilling. I tried the mushroom and truffle oil pizza via UberEats one day and I'm now hooked! It's like a gourmet Pizza Hut pan pizza on steroids! You probably won't like this if you're into Neopolitan style, and you'll probably curse me while explaining that this isn't pizza if you're Italian, but otherwise, give this place a try!", 'positive'], [" Really, really don't see the hype! Yes the dough and crust are awesome and well cooked but that's where this pizza ends. On the Electric Avenue, you could literally taste none of the ingredients. The chicken, pineapple, green onions, etc. all melded together and none were memorable. Worst of all, the key to a great pizza is potent, melted cheese with flavour. None of the pizzas, including the Electric Avenue, had any of this. A serious disappointment given the hype. There are so many different, better pizza options in the city. Might as well go out west to Mississauga to Mickey's for deep dish pizza rather than eat this mediocre stuff. Will not be returning. Price is FAR too high for the quality. On top of that, the wait staff was really apathetic and rude. The guy served us our pizzas while taking an order on the phone. Didn't even acknowledge us or say anything to us. Pretty rude in my opinion and a true air of not caring. Also, they brought out all 3 pizzas at separate times which is never great. You should be able to get all people's orders in a party timed correctly so they all come out together. Believe me when I say that this place cares way more about pumping out pizzas left, right and centre than they do treating their customers with respect. Yes, they'll make lots of money, but I think they really need to check themselves and work on their pizzas and service.", 'negative'], [' Lets be honest people. \xa0This place is over hyped by the hipsters and millennials. \xa0 Their pizza is average at best. \xa0The only way I can describe is it like biting into greasy plasticine with a cement burned crust. \xa0I know the angry owner who doesn\'t take criticism lightly will bash this. \xa0This is your PRIME example of how a business can be successful by PURE hype and "hipsterization". \xa0And for that Chris, congrats on stealing peoples money with your overpriced rectangular loafs of dough with idiotic toppings that should never ever be labeled as a pizza.

It's so hard to find even at big liquor stores. I finally had a pour here and it was awesome. At $15 Cdn for a generous pour it ain't so bad. My local generic sports bar in the Tri-state area will charge more than that for something more run of the mill like Makers mark.  From the modernist menu we had the apricot modern cocktail ($30) which arrived looking like a museum piece with little balls of apricot candy inside looking like Christmas tree ornaments. It tasted delicious as well. Smooth and slightly strong with a hint of flavor from the islay scotch pete. Not syrupy or too sweet.  Was it worth $30? That's subjective.

The bartenders take pride in what they do and it shows! The waiters were very professional and on point with their service. They do serve small snack foods like fries, chicken pieces& sliders. There are other options on the menu, we just never got a chance to try them. It is pricier than a regular bar but it\'s because you are paying for the quality of service, quality of drinks and food. The atmosphere was very romantic and relaxing.  This was the best birthday I\'ve ever had! I\'m 100% recommending BarChef as a place you have to try if your visiting Toronto.', 'positive'], [" When someone asks for your go-to cocktail these days, too often the answer is a whiskey sour, negroni, or gin and tonic. Now there is nothing necessarily wrong about that response, but why do we not seek out experimentation or aesthetic in what we drink as much in what we eat? True to its name, BarChef seeks to overturn that standard and with great success. First things first, the vibe in BarChef is both casual and elegant at the same time. In the front seating area, it is dark to the point of blindness, the only illumination coming from a scattering of candles and of course the blinding light of phones flashing for the 'gram. The well-appointed black leather furniture fits the lighting (or the lack thereof), and invite you to recline and fully soak in your cocktail in all its glory.  I will get straight to the point - the Vanilla Hickory Smoked Manhattan ($50) is a must get for the whiskey lover, novice, or anyone in between. The price is steep, but if there were one cocktail I would spend it on, it would be this one. Initially, the presentation invites curiosity, with a bell-shaped glass lid perched on top of a pile of smoldering wood chips filled with swirling smoke. The server returns minutes later to reveal the singular crystal goblet of Canadian whisky infused with the sweet notes of hickory. Each sip literally comes with the nostalgic aroma of a cabin fireplace, which lingers long after the glass's contents have been consumed. I also tried my friends' Sailor's Mojito, Black Truffle, Apricot, and Creme de Blanc - all presented different textures, aromas, and flavors. As the menu is seasonal, do not fret if you do not see one of these on the menu. However, you can likely count on both the Manhattan and Mojito to be present year-round. Our server was very helpful in guiding us through the extensive cocktail list, although it helped that we were set on ordering off the Modernist section. If you are a fan of magic or simply like to drink, you should come here immediately. Every time I am in Toronto, I will make a point to grab a drink at BarChef without fail.", 'positive'], [' Been here twice and had the best time on both instances. Barchef offers unique, creative, and potent mixes in fun presentations. Seems that they change their menu based on the season. I had the Daquiri Adaptation in July but it was not available in March, so I ordered the Spring Thaw instead. Both drinks came in extravagant presentations which is part of the whole experience. But if you just want a straight forward and simple drink, they can do that as well. Food menu is limited, tried their truffle potato chips, fries, fried chicken, sliders, and spiced nuts. All were tasty and goes well with the strong drinks. Service is excellent, wait staff and front desk are super friendly, efficient, and helpful.

Highly recommended this place for a quick cocktail and snacks. But be warned that this place fills up.  While some drinks (like the ones we ordered) were pricey, each is carefully crafted and an unique experience. Servers complement the drinks with a brief background on how to best enjoy and taste the flavours of each drink.  I had the "do it for the gram" drink called the "Essence of fall" to which truly was an experience in itself, at one point flooding the table we shared with fog (sorry not sorry).

We got sucked into to the gimmicky dry ice, and took a huge walk to get here from down town, got soaked in the rain - it was not worth it at all.

Maybe I am just not trendy enough to understand why I should be paying 15 dollars for a drink. I came here on a Wednesday night and it was full of bar owners and 22-year old drunk girls. It took forever for the bartender to even ask us for a drink because he was too busy trying to impress everyone with his flaming brandy and dry ice. Seriously, he took 20 minutes to make one drink for some rich suit and it had dry ice served in a bowl. Maybe this sort of thing is cool for people who have seen it all, but I would have been more than happy if he just pulled a beer out of the fridge and popped off the cap. While the bartender took his sweet time making drinks the owner explained to his "clients" what he was doing. It was as if I walked in on some bartending convention that I was surely not a part of. I felt uncomfortable and out of place. I finished my 15 dollar drink (which just tasted like alcoholic Kool-Aid) and was out the door -- heading to a place where I wouldn\'t be looked down upon. This used to be a jazz bar before it was Bar Chef and I would always walk by thinking the place looked cozy and interesting. I regret not checking it out back then because I\'m surely never coming back here.

There is the potential, but still a lack of discipline. There are so few of them that actually do things properly and in accordance with their price-point without being pretentious.

We walked in and I was immediately thrilled with our choice. It was dark and loud and exactly what I was in the mood for. We were seated at the bar and presented with an extremely extensive menu. The drinks are all quite innovative and different and I wound up getting two: Scotch Bramble ("Orange Scotch, honey and black pepper syrup, fresh lemon, cherry and vanilla bitter, tonic water, bitter almond"): Though perhaps a touch sweeter than I would\'ve liked, this was definitely a very flavorful and potent beverage that was incredibly easy to drink. For my next drink, I noticed that they had a handful of varieties of absinthe on the menu and since I\'d never tried the notorious drink, I had to order one. (I went with the Dillon\'s.) The bartender first brought out this elaborite statue-type thing that contained icy water, and we first thought we were meant to refill our water glasses. But when the drink came out, complete with the cube of sugar above the glass, it became clear it was meant to drip water into the beverage and dilute it to my preference. It is, as expected, an extremely strong drink. I was basically coughing after every sip but I enjoyed it. It\'s so different from anything I\'ve ever had before. And the presentation was certainly quite stellar. We also decided to order a couple of dishes to snack on: Croquettes ("mushroom and prosciutto") and Japanese Fried Chicken ("soy and sesame"): Both of these items were just about perfect and completely hit the spot. They arrived piping hot, too, so that\'s always a plus. Now, the big downside to our experience was after we had received our food and second drinks we were literally ignored by our server for the rest of the night. We would\'ve ordered a third drink each but the bartender was too busy with other orders to check on us. We finally grew so annoyed we just wanted the bill but still he didn\'t check in with us at any point, even after we were sitting there in our coats. Finally we flagged him down, which I hate to do because it just seems aggressive, and asked for our bill, although I\'ll admit I was tempted to just walk out.

By the time he had returned, she had taken away all of what I paid 30 dollars for (the dry ice and the serving tray etc).

I decided to take my wife out for a Saturday morning breakfast as she didn\'t have to work. We were told the wait would be about 45 mins and our names were taken. We decided to stay and wait inside as it was cold and raining out. But as we approached the front of the line as time went on, we noticed that there were a number of empty tables and the bar was completely empty. Pretty much everyone said they\'d take the bar seats if it was faster. Finally after about 45 mins wait we saw a lady and her young daughter get taken to the bar which had been empty for about 30 mins. The couple in front of us were next and were asked if they would sit at the bar, but elected to wait for a table. They also noticed a number of empty tables and asked the waitress, those tables look empty, can\'t we just sit there? The waitress said they just needed to "set the table up" before they could seat them there... I found this odd. After an hour we were tired of waiting, and seeing as only 2 of the 6 bar seats were taken, we asked politely, can\'t we just sit at the bar now since we were only like 3rd on the list. They said there were a couple people ahead of us... meanwhile I had noticed a table of 4 with a high chair had been vacant for the last 30 mins. And then the lady in front who seemed to be in charge of this unorganized establishment said to the couple waiting with a baby if they were waiting for a table with a high chair and just took them in... finally... it was our turn and we were escorted to a table in the back, when I sat down I noticed 4 empty tables back here?! I was extremely puzzled as to why this place has a 1 hour+ wait when they have 30-40% of the seating available at all times... I am never coming back to this place again and I wish everyone reads this before they waste 1-1.5 hours of their life waiting for an empty seat that is deemed worthy to be filled by the lady up front. This has to be one of the most unorganized restaurants I\'ve ever been to.  The one positive thing I can say is that the server was very nice and fast. Oh btw... we ordered a classic breakfast, a benny breakfast and two coffees... the food is mediocre. Maybe it\'s just the bad taste left in my mouth from waiting so long when there were empty seats all a long.', 'negative'], [" We waited about an hour for brunch on a Friday which was a bit surprising.

They only have donuts on Saturday's, the rest of the week it's a very basic menu. I got there was treated terribly I sat at a table and was asked if I was there alone I said Yes, but the waiter didn't seem to care and put in extra place set. When he dropped off two menus I told him again I was alone, he took my order which was the blueberry pancakes, a side of bacon and a hot apple cider. He told me he would get the apple cider first, instead he forgot and it didn't come until I asked for it when my food arrived. The food was delicious but when I went to pay I was told they don't take American Express, it would be nice if this was listed somewhere I paid and once I looked at my receipt saw that I was over charged for the bacon.

As usual we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table, which is the norm and we don\'t mind. We were called about our table being ready and when we arrived we had to wait another 8 minutes or so to be seated. Once seated we ordered right away. I got the eggs Benny and my partner got the sausage gravy and eggs. We ordered coffees as well. The coffee arrived warm, not hot, and when the food arrived it was cold. The "hollandaise" sauce (the sauce has a different name but can\'t remember what it is) in particular was cold and since it was poured over the eggs, biscuits and bacon, it negatively impacted the entire dish. But what really disappointed us about our dining experience was the service. We had to put our hand up and ask three different people to finally get cream for our coffees - 10 minute wait. We then had to do the same to get a refill. Though they have a lot of staff, they lacked efficiency and coordination. So, cold food, bad service, and lack of attention made this dining experience at Emma\'s our last.', 'negative'], [' This place isn\'t dairy, gluten or vegan-friendly. My partner couldn\'t eat anything without risk of gut inflammation. After eating their standard eggs, sausage (it wasn\'t a "sausage" per say but rather the grounding of the meat without the casein), potatoes and homemade bread, I started to feel sick and ended up in the bathroom for 10 minutes at a different establishment. My partner would have been fine if they were able to cook the eggs, sausage, and potatoes separately on a pan without the use of butter, but they were not able to accommodate. So, I felt really bad and ended up cooking him lunch at my house.  The cappuccino was not special for the $4.50 price tag. It was served in a regular coffee mug with lots of foam topped, almost spilling out. I am not expecting Italy, but there are other establishments that can serve way better cappuccino for half the price.  I really hope breakfast establishments focus on being diet-friendly to people that are dairy and gluten sensitive. I mean, I am OK, but I watch out for my partner\'s needs, too.

I wish one of us could have jumped out of the car while we were looking for parking and got our name in the waiting list. We ordered Emma's Benny and Biscuits & Gravy. Though I have heard a lot about their Eggs Benedict, I didn't like it too much as the Bene Sauce was not that great. It did not have great consistency it was a bit more sort of watery. I like my bene sauce rich in consistency. My husband makes better benedict sauce than they did. Poached eggs were good though had running yolk and that's exactly how I like it. In fact the server asked me how I like my poached egg and of course I said soft with yolk ooozing out of it. Sausage and Gravy was okay but I did not like the scrambled egg that came with it. It was too dry for me. I like my scrambled egg creamy and again I make better scrambled eggs then they did. May be this was one time thing and happened to me.
